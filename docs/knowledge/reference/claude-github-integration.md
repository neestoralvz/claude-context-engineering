## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **Step 1: Installation via Claude Code**

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
# Launch Claude Code
claude

# Run the installation command
/install-github-app
```

This command will:
1. Guide you through GitHub app installation
2. Help configure repository permissions  
3. Set up required secrets and authentication
4. Provide setup verification

### **Step 2: Manual Installation (Alternative)**

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Visit GitHub App**: Navigate to https://github.com/apps/claude
2. **Install to Repository**: Select repositories and grant permissions
3. **Add API Key**: Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to repository secrets
4. **Configure Workflow**: Copy GitHub Actions workflow to `.github/workflows/`

### **Step 3: First @claude Interaction**

Create a test issue:
```markdown
**Issue Title**: Add user authentication system

**Description**: 
We need a JWT-based authentication system with:
- User registration endpoint
- Login with email/password
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt

@claude implement this authentication system based on the requirements above
```

**Result**: Claude analyzes the issue and creates a complete PR with authentication implementation.

- **Branch Protection**: Recommended for production repositories

### **Detailed Installation Process**

### **Method 1: Claude Code Command (Recommended)**

```bash
# Start Claude Code session
claude

# Execute installation command
/install-github-app

# Follow interactive prompts for:
# 1. GitHub repository selection
# 2. Permission configuration
# 3. API key setup
# 4. Workflow file creation
# 5. Initial testing
```

### **Method 2: Manual GitHub Setup**

**Step 1: Install GitHub App**

  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  claude-response:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          trigger-phrase: '@claude'
```

### **Configuration Optimization**

****CLAUDE.md Integration****
Create `CLAUDE.md` in repository root for optimal AI behavior:

```markdown
# Project Context for Claude

## Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

## Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, prefer type safety
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for components
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier with project-specific rules
- **Git**: Conventional commit messages required

## Development Patterns
- **Components**: Functional components with React hooks
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state

```

### **Advanced Workflow Configuration**

**CRITICAL Custom Trigger Phrases Configuration**:
```yaml
# Customize trigger phrases for different behaviors
with:
  trigger-phrase: '@claude'
  review-trigger: '@claude review'
  implement-trigger: '@claude implement'
  fix-trigger: '@claude fix'
```

**CRITICAL Conditional Response Configuration**:
```yaml
# Respond only to specific users or teams
if: |
  contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude') && 
  (github.actor == 'team-lead' || contains(github.event.comment.author_association, 'COLLABORATOR'))
```

     https://api.anthropic.com/v1/usage/monthly

# Repository-specific usage tracking
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs \
  --jq '.workflow_runs[] | select(.name == "Claude Code Integration") | .conclusion'
```

****Performance Optimization Strategies****
```yaml
# Optimize Claude responses for efficiency
with:
  anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  model: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307'  # Faster model for simple tasks
  max-tokens: 50000                  # Limit response size

## 🔧 Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### **Installation Issues**

****GitHub App Permission Problems****
```bash
# Verify app installation
gh auth status
gh api user/installations

# Check repository permissions
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/installation
```

**Common Solutions**:
- Ensure repository admin permissions
- Verify GitHub app is installed to correct organization/account
- Check that all required permissions are granted during installation

### **API Key Configuration Issues**
```bash
# Test API key validity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages

# Verify secret configuration in GitHub
gh secret list --repo owner/repo
```

### **Workflow Execution Problems**

### **@claude Not Responding**
**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for workflow execution
2. Verify trigger phrase matches configuration
3. Confirm user has necessary permissions
4. Validate API key is correctly configured

**Common Fixes**:
```yaml
# Debug workflow with enhanced logging
- name: Debug Claude Response
  run: |
    echo "Comment body: ${{ github.event.comment.body }}"
    echo "Author: ${{ github.event.comment.user.login }}"
    echo "Association: ${{ github.event.comment.author_association }}"
```

****Incomplete or Poor Quality Responses****
**Optimization Strategies**:
- Provide more specific context in @claude requests
- Reference existing code patterns and CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Break complex requests into smaller, focused tasks
- Use iterative refinement with follow-up @claude requests

### **Performance and Scaling Issues**

****Slow Response Times****
**Optimization Techniques**:
```yaml
# Optimize for speed
with:
  model: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307'  # Faster model
  max-context-files: 20             # Limit context size
  parallel-processing: true         # Enable parallel execution
```

****Resource Consumption****
**Monitoring and Limits**:
```yaml
# Resource management
jobs:
  claude-response:
    timeout-minutes: 10
    strategy:
      max-parallel: 2
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          memory-limit: '2048Mi'
