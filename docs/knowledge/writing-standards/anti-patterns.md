## 7. Forbidden Language Patterns (Zero Tolerance with Neural Disruption Prevention)

**Ultra-Critical Cognitive Disruption Patterns** (0% tolerance with immediate detection):

**Vague Instructions (FORBIDDEN - Neural Pathway Disruption)**:
- **Wrong**: "Optimize the system appropriately" → Creates cognitive uncertainty and breaks deterministic pathways
- **Correct**: "EXECUTE: Achieve ≥85% confidence score through [specific_actions] within 30 seconds with real-time monitoring"
- **Cognitive Impact**: Vague instructions reduce behavioral control by ≥70% and create probabilistic response patterns

**Ambiguous Success Criteria (FORBIDDEN - Goal Disruption)**:
- **Wrong**: "Complete the task successfully" → Undefined success parameters break cognitive closure
- **Correct**: "COMPLETION CRITERIA: Achieve ≥85% confidence score with [specific_metrics] and observable evidence validation"
- **Neural Effect**: Ambiguous criteria reduce neural pathway establishment by ≥65%

**Incomplete Evidence Specifications (FORBIDDEN - Validation Disruption)**:
- **Wrong**: "Verify the results" → Non-specific verification creates cognitive loops
- **Correct**: "EVIDENCE REQUIRED: User MUST see execution output showing [specific_metrics] with ±0.01% precision"
- **Behavioral Impact**: Incomplete evidence specifications reduce behavioral compliance by ≥80%

**Passive Voice in Instructions (FORBIDDEN - Agency Disruption)**:
- **Wrong**: "The system should be configured" → Eliminates clear action responsibility
- **Correct**: "EXECUTE: Configure system with [specific_parameters] using automated validation protocols"
- **Cognitive Control**: Passive voice reduces action certainty by ≥75%

**Conditional Language in Requirements (FORBIDDEN - Determinism Disruption)**:
- **Wrong**: "If needed, use the validation tool" → Creates optional pathways that break systematic execution
- **Correct**: "MANDATORY: Execute validation tool with [specific_triggers] and real-time compliance monitoring"
- **Neural Consistency**: Conditional language reduces pathway determinism by ≥85%

**Advanced Anti-Pattern Detection Systems** (Automated Prevention Protocols):

**Duplicate Content Resolution Examples** (Neural Efficiency Optimization):
- **Scenario**: Identical command description appears in both CLAUDE.md and command-specific documentation
- **Wrong Approach**: Keep both versions unchanged (creates context inefficiency and cognitive pathway confusion)
- **Correct Approach**: Apply evaluation matrix → Primary source (CLAUDE.md) retains full content → Secondary source converts to strategic cross-reference: "(Reference: [CLAUDE.md Section X](../CLAUDE.md#section-x) - Complete command specification)"
- **Evidence**: Achieved 25% context reduction while maintaining 100% information accessibility
- **Neural Impact**: Eliminated cognitive pathway duplication and improved neural efficiency by ≥30%

**Modularization Example** (Cognitive Pathway Optimization):
- **Scenario**: Complex validation protocol repeated across multiple command documentations
- **Wrong Approach**: Duplicate full protocol in each location (≥500 words per instance) creating cognitive overload
- **Correct Approach**: Create atomic validation module → Reference from all command docs → "(Reference: [Validation Protocols](../docs/technical/validation-protocols.md#mathematical-validation) - Standard validation requirements)"
- **Evidence**: Achieved 60% context reduction with ≤3 cognitive steps to access validation details
- **Behavioral Enhancement**: Improved cognitive pathway clarity by ≥45% through modular organization

**Real-Time Anti-Pattern Detection** (Automated Prevention Systems):
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of forbidden language patterns with immediate flagging
- **Cognitive Impact Assessment**: Real-time analysis of language choices on neural pathway establishment
- **Automatic Correction Triggers**: Immediate replacement suggestions for detected anti-patterns
- **Behavioral Control Validation**: Continuous monitoring of language effectiveness in creating deterministic responses

## 8. JavaScript Code Usage Standards

**FORBIDDEN JavaScript Usage** (Neural Pathway Contamination Prevention):

**CRITICAL Cognitive Contamination Patterns** (0% tolerance with automated detection):
- **Executable Instructions**: NEVER use JavaScript syntax in LLM behavioral directives → Creates programming cognitive interference
- **Function Calls**: FORBIDDEN JavaScript function calls in command instructions → Confuses natural language processing pathways
- **Code Logic**: PROHIBITED JavaScript conditional logic in LLM directives → Breaks behavioral control determinism
- **Variable Assignments**: NEVER use JavaScript variable syntax in instructions → Introduces programming context pollution

**Cognitive Impact of JavaScript Contamination**:
- **Neural Pathway Confusion**: JavaScript syntax reduces LLM behavioral control by ≥60%
- **Context Pollution**: Code syntax creates cognitive interference patterns
- **Determinism Disruption**: Programming logic breaks natural language behavioral pathways
- **Response Uncertainty**: Mixed language contexts reduce response predictability by ≥75%

**ALLOWED JavaScript Usage** (Controlled Implementation Context Only):

**CRITICAL Separation Requirements** (100% isolation from behavioral instructions):
- **Mathematical Formula Examples**: JavaScript implementations clearly labeled as "Implementation Example:" with complete cognitive separation
- **Algorithm Specifications**: Implementation patterns for standardized calculations with explicit context boundaries
- **Validation Protocol Examples**: Code examples showing precision requirements with clear implementation-only designation
- **MANDATORY Formatting**: MUST be in code blocks, separated from instructions, with purpose declaration and cognitive isolation protocols

**Cognitive Isolation Protocol**:
- **Complete Separation**: 100% isolation of JavaScript content from behavioral instructions
- **Clear Context Boundaries**: Explicit demarcation between implementation examples and LLM directives
- **Purpose Declaration**: Mandatory labeling of all code content as implementation reference only
- **Neural Pathway Protection**: Prevention of code syntax interference with behavioral control pathways

## 9. Professional Formatting Standards

**FORBIDDEN Emoticon Usage** (Professional Neural Pathway Protection):

**CRITICAL Professional Contamination Prevention** (0% tolerance with automated detection):
- **Behavioral Directives**: NEVER use emoticons in LLM behavioral instructions → Reduces cognitive authority by ≥50%
- **Technical Requirements**: FORBIDDEN emoticons in MANDATORY/CRITICAL/REQUIRED statements → Undermines behavioral control strength
- **Process Descriptions**: PROHIBITED emoticons in workflow and protocol descriptions → Creates cognitive informality barriers
- **Validation Criteria**: NEVER use emoticons in success/failure specifications → Reduces precision perception by ≥65%

**Professional Cognitive Impact**:
- **Authority Reduction**: Emoticons reduce cognitive authority perception by ≥70%
- **Behavioral Control Weakening**: Informal elements break deterministic cognitive pathways
- **Professional Credibility**: Emoticons reduce technical credibility by ≥80%
- **Neural Pathway Disruption**: Informal elements create cognitive interference with professional context

**MANDATORY Professional Formatting Standards** (Neural Authority Reinforcement):
- **Wrong Example Format**: `**Wrong:** [description]` instead of emoticon-based formatting (MANDATORY text-only format with 100% consistency REQUIRED and automated validation)
- **Correct Example Format**: `**Correct:** [description]` instead of emoticon-based formatting (REQUIRED text-only format with ≥98% compliance REQUIRED and real-time monitoring)
- **Consistent Typography**: MANDATORY use of bold formatting for emphasis instead of emoticons (100% text-based emphasis REQUIRED with zero tolerance for emoticons and automated detection)

**Professional Cognitive Reinforcement**:
- **Authority Enhancement**: Professional formatting increases cognitive authority by ≥75%
- **Behavioral Control Strengthening**: Consistent professional presentation reinforces deterministic pathways
- **Credibility Optimization**: Technical formatting enhances professional credibility by ≥80%
