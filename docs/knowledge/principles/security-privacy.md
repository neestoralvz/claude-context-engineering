- **Data Archival**: CRITICAL secure long-term storage with compliance requirements for PERMANENT preservation

**CRITICAL Privacy Protection**:
- **Privacy by Design**: MANDATORY privacy controls integrated into system architecture for SYSTEMATIC protection
- **Consent Management**: REQUIRED granular consent management with user control for MAXIMUM privacy rights
- **Data Minimization**: ESSENTIAL collection of ONLY necessary data with purpose limitation for MINIMAL exposure
- **Right to Erasure**: AUTOMATIC data deletion with verification for COMPLETE privacy compliance

**MANDATORY Compliance Monitoring**:
- **Regulatory Reporting**: AUTOMATED compliance reporting with audit trails for CONTINUOUS validation
- **Policy Enforcement**: REQUIRED automated policy enforcement with exception handling for SYSTEMATIC compliance
- **Compliance Dashboard**: REAL-TIME compliance status with risk indicators for IMMEDIATE visibility
- **Audit Preparation**: AUTOMATIC audit preparation with evidence collection for RAPID response

**Compliance Validation Metrics**:
