# Git Strategy Protocols for Context Engineering

## 🎯 Strategic Git Framework

### **Branch Strategy** (GitFlow Enhanced)

```
🌟 main (PRODUCTION)                    ← Stable releases only
├── 🔄 development (INTEGRATION)       ← Feature integration & testing
├── 🚀 feature/* (DEVELOPMENT)         ← New features & enhancements
├── 🔧 hotfix/* (CRITICAL FIXES)       ← Production critical fixes
├── 📊 experiment/* (RESEARCH)         ← Experimental features
└── 🎯 release/* (STAGING)             ← Release preparation
```

### **Branch Protection Rules**

**Main Branch Protection:**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers minimum)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ✅ Restrict pushes to main (PR only)

**Development Branch Protection:**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer minimum)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Allow administrator override for urgent fixes

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow & Recovery Points

### **Deployment Pipeline** (Automated)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Feature Branch] --> B{Validation Suite}
    B --> C[Development Branch]
    C --> D{Integration Tests}
    D --> E[Staging Deployment]
    E --> F{Performance Tests}
    F --> G[Production Deployment]
    G --> H[Health Checks]
    H --> I{Success?}
    I -->|No| J[Auto Rollback]
    I -->|Yes| K[Deployment Complete]
    J --> L[Recovery Point Restored]
```

### **Recovery Points Strategy**

**Automatic Recovery Points:**
- ✅ Pre-deployment snapshot (main branch)
- ✅ Post-validation checkpoint (development branch)
- ✅ Feature completion markers
- ✅ Daily automatic backups (command registry, configs)

**Recovery Commands:**
```bash
# Quick rollback to last stable state
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # If last commit caused issues

# Rollback to specific recovery point
git checkout main
git reset --hard <recovery-point-hash>

# Emergency rollback with backup restoration
./scripts/deployment/emergency-rollback.sh <backup-timestamp>
```

## 🤖 Automation Protocols

### **Git Hooks** (Automated Quality Gates)

**Pre-commit Hook:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "🔍 Running pre-commit validation..."

# Run system integrity validation
./scripts/validation/validate-system-integrity.sh
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ System integrity validation failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Run mathematical formula verification
./scripts/compliance/verify-mathematical-formulas.sh
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Mathematical formula verification failed"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit validation passed"
```

**Pre-push Hook:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-push

echo "🚀 Running pre-push validation..."

# Run comprehensive quality metrics
./scripts/validation/calculate-comprehensive-quality-metrics.sh
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Quality metrics validation failed"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-push validation passed"
```

### **Automated Workflows**

**Daily Maintenance:**
```bash
# .github/workflows/daily-maintenance.yml
name: Daily System Maintenance

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM UTC

jobs:
  maintenance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Backup Command Registry
        run: ./scripts/core/backup-command-registry.sh
        
      - name: Update Performance Metrics
        run: ./scripts/core/calculate-real-metrics.sh
        
      - name: Validate System Health
        run: ./scripts/validation/validate-system-integrity.sh
```

**Pattern Crystallization Trigger:**
```bash
# Automatic pattern detection and crystallization
name: Pattern Crystallization

on:
  push:
    branches: [ development ]
    paths: [ '.claude/commands/**', 'docs/patterns/**' ]

jobs:
  crystallize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Detect Patterns
        run: ./scripts/automation/pattern-detection.sh
        
      - name: Create Crystallization PR
        if: patterns detected
        run: ./scripts/automation/create-crystallization-pr.sh
```

## 👥 Collaborative Development Patterns

### **Team Workflow**

**Feature Development:**
1. Create feature branch from `development`
2. Implement with TDD approach (`/tdd` command)
3. Run validation suite locally
4. Submit PR to `development` branch
5. Code review + automated testing
6. Merge after approval + CI success

**Hotfix Workflow:**
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Implement critical fix
3. Fast-track validation (P55/P56 compliance)
4. Deploy to staging for verification
5. Merge to both `main` and `development`
6. Tag as patch release

### **Code Review Standards**

**Required Checks:**
- ✅ P55/P56 compliance validation
- ✅ Mathematical formula verification
- ✅ Navigation integrity (≤3 steps rule)
- ✅ Context optimization validation
- ✅ Command coherence verification

**Review Checklist:**
```markdown

# .git/hooks/post-merge

echo "📊 Updating performance metrics..."
./scripts/core/calculate-real-metrics.sh

# Update command usage analytics
./scripts/automation/update-command-analytics.sh

# Generate performance report
./scripts/validation/calculate-comprehensive-quality-metrics.sh
```

**Key Performance Indicators:**

logs/sensitive/
debug/personal/

# Temporary files with potential data
tmp/
*.tmp
.DS_Store
```

**Compliance Validation:**
```bash
# Pre-commit compliance check
./scripts/compliance/validate-security-compliance.sh
./scripts/compliance/validate-data-privacy.sh
```

### **Audit Trail**

**Comprehensive Logging:**
- 📝 All command executions logged
- 🔍 Pattern crystallization events tracked
- 📊 Performance metrics archived
- 🛡️ Security events monitored
