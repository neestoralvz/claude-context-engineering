## 🎯 Integration Purpose

**AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION**: Every TodoWrite operation triggers TRIPLE verification:
1. **Zero-Root File Policy** - No unauthorized files in project root 
2. **🚨 MAXIMUM Density Optimization** - All communication achieves ≥75% character reduction with ≤0.8s comprehension
3. **🚨 MANDATORY Parallel Task Planning** - Complex todo elaboration (≥2 tasks, complexity ≥0.6) triggers automatic parallel Task tool deployment per [Principle #96](../principles/operational-excellence.md#96-todowrite-parallel-task-integration)

**SEAMLESS OPERATION**: Integration operates transparently without disrupting user workflow while maintaining 100% compliance with Principles #81, #82, #90, and #96.

## 🔄 TodoWrite Integration Points

### **Task Completion Triggers**
```yaml
todowrite_integration:
  task_completion:
    trigger: "Any todo marked as 'completed'"
    zero_root_verification: "Execute immediate zero-root file scan"
    density_verification: "🚨 MAXIMUM: Validate communication density ≥75% reduction + ≤0.8s comprehension"
    parallel_task_compliance: "Verify parallel Task deployment compliance for complex todos"
    automatic_correction: "IMMEDIATE blocking and correction of density violations"

    trigger: "Any TodoWrite operation (add, modify, complete)"
    scan: "Check for files created during task execution"
    validate: "Ensure all new files follow Zero-Root Policy"
    parallel_detection: "Detect complexity thresholds requiring parallel task deployment"
    timing: "after_todowrite_execution"
    
  file_generation_tasks:
    trigger: "Tasks involving file creation or document generation"
    pre_validation: "Verify target paths before file creation"
    post_validation: "Confirm proper file placement after completion"

      action: "AUTOMATIC parallel domain specialist deployment"
      domains: "strategic, technical, resource, risk, integration analysis"

```

### **Automatic Verification Logic**
**NATURAL LANGUAGE WORKFLOW** (P56 Compliance - Code Syntax Eliminated):

**TodoWrite Operation Protocol**:
1. **Pre-Execution Analysis**: Examine todo operation for file generation requirements and complexity assessment
2. **Parallel Task Detection**: MANDATORY analysis for complexity thresholds requiring parallel Task deployment
3. **BLOCKING Enforcement**: IMMEDIATE halt if complexity ≥0.6 with ≥2 tasks OR multi-domain span without parallel Tools
4. **TodoWrite Execution**: Execute todo operation with real-time parallel Task compliance monitoring
5. **Triple Verification**: Post-execution verification of Zero-Root Policy, Density Optimization, and Parallel Task Compliance
6. **Transparency Announcement**: Comprehensive verification status with all compliance metrics validated

**CRITICAL Enforcement Points**:
- **Planning Complexity ≥0.7**: AUTOMATIC parallel Task tool deployment (≥3 specialists)
- **Multi-Domain Todos**: MANDATORY specialized domain analysis via parallel Task tools
- **Sequential Planning Detection**: IMMEDIATE blocking with redirection to parallel Task execution
- **TodoWrite Elaboration**: Complex todo updates require parallel analysis before execution
- **Compliance Verification**: 100% validation of Principles #81, #82, #90, and #96 requirements
