## üéØ Integration Purpose

**AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION**: Every TodoWrite operation triggers DUAL verification:
1. **Zero-Root File Policy** - No unauthorized files in project root 
2. **üö® MAXIMUM Density Optimization** - All communication achieves ‚â•75% character reduction with ‚â§0.8s comprehension

**SEAMLESS OPERATION**: Integration operates transparently without disrupting user workflow while maintaining 100% compliance with Principles #81 and #82.

## üîÑ TodoWrite Integration Points

### **Task Completion Triggers**
```yaml
todowrite_integration:
  task_completion:
    trigger: "Any todo marked as 'completed'"
    zero_root_verification: "Execute immediate zero-root file scan"
    density_verification: "üö® MAXIMUM: Validate communication density ‚â•75% reduction + ‚â§0.8s comprehension"
    automatic_correction: "IMMEDIATE blocking and correction of density violations"
    announcement: "üìã TASK COMPLETION VERIFIED: Zero-Root Policy maintained"
    timing: "immediate_post_completion"
    
  todo_list_update:
    trigger: "Any TodoWrite operation (add, modify, complete)"
    scan: "Check for files created during task execution"
    validate: "Ensure all new files follow Zero-Root Policy"
    timing: "after_todowrite_execution"
    
  file_generation_tasks:
    trigger: "Tasks involving file creation or document generation"
    pre_validation: "Verify target paths before file creation"
    post_validation: "Confirm proper file placement after completion"
    priority: "maximum"
```

### **Automatic Verification Logic**
```javascript
// TodoWrite Integration Pseudocode
function onTodoWriteOperation(todoOperation) {
    // Pre-execution validation for file-generating tasks
    if (todoOperation.involvesFileGeneration) {
        validateTargetPaths(todoOperation.filePaths);
    }
    
    // Execute TodoWrite operation
    executeTodoOperation(todoOperation);
    
    // MANDATORY Post-execution verification
    if (todoOperation.completed || todoOperation.modified) {
        executeZeroRootVerification({
            trigger: "todowrite_completion",
            command: "TodoWrite",
            transparency: true,
            autoResolve: true,
            announcement: "üìã TASK COMPLETION VERIFIED: Zero-Root Policy maintained"
        });
    }
}
```
