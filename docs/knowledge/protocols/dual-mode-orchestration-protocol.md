# Dual-Mode Command Orchestration Protocol

**Status**: ACTIVE - Principio #103 Implementation  
**Priority**: MANDATORY - Critical for intelligent command coordination  
**Integration**: Autocontained commands with dual-mode communication

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Protocol Definition

**CRITICAL Understanding**: Commands communicate via two distinct modes:
- **Read Tool**: Current agent adopts personality/behavior of `/[command]`
- **Task Tool**: Creates new specialized agent instance executing `/[command]`

**MANDATORY Principle**: Each mode serves different orchestration needs while maintaining Principle #102 autocontenciÃ³n.

## ðŸŽ­ Orchestration Patterns

### **Sequential Orchestration**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Read Adoption] --> B[Analysis Phase] --> C[Task Deployment] --> D[Execution Phase] --> E[Result Synthesis]
```

**Implementation**:
1. **Read** `/thinking` for analytical personality adoption
2. **Analyze** requirements with adopted strategic thinking
3. **Task** deploy specialized agents based on analysis
4. **Execute** parallel agent operations
5. **Synthesize** results with coordination expertise

### **Parallel Orchestration**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Orchestration Start] --> B[Read Adoption]
    A --> C[Task Agent 1]
    A --> D[Task Agent 2]
    A --> E[Task Agent 3]
    B --> F[Synthesis Coordination]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

**Implementation**:
- **Simultaneous** Read adoption + Task deployment
- **Parallel** personality adoption with agent spawning
- **Coordinated** synthesis of multiple specializations

### **Recursive Orchestration**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Primary Agent] --> B[Read Sub-Specialization]
    A --> C[Task Sub-Agent 1]
    A --> D[Task Sub-Agent 2]
    C --> E[Read Further Specialization]
    D --> F[Task Further Sub-Agents]
```

**Implementation**:
- **Task agents** use Read for sub-specialization
- **Recursive** depth of specialization within agent contexts
- **Compound** intelligence through layered specialization
