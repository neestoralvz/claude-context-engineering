# 🚨 Zero-Root File Verification Protocol

**🚨 BLOCKING Protocol**: Automated verification system with MANDATORY prevention mechanisms for **Principle #81: Zero-Root File Policy** ensuring NO files are created in project root except CLAUDE.md and README.md with AUTOMATIC blocking and real-time violation detection.

## 🎯 Protocol Purpose

**🚨 BLOCKING Integration**: Every command that creates files MUST execute Zero-Root File verification as final step with P56 transparency announcements and AUTOMATIC violation prevention. Sistema WILL block file creation that violates Zero-Root Policy.

**🚨 MAXIMUM PRIORITY**: This protocol has precedence over all other file organization protocols and MUST be verified before ANY file creation operation with MANDATORY blocking of violations and AUTOMATIC correction protocols.

```

### **File Type Classification Matrix**
```yaml
file_classification:
  handoffs:
    pattern: "HANDOFF_*.md, coordination files, task transitions"
    destination: "/handoffs/"
    auto_create: true
    
  reports:
    pattern: "*_REPORT.md, *_ANALYSIS.md, compliance documents"
    destination: "/reports/"
    auto_create: true
    
  outputs:
    pattern: "temporary results, validation outputs, processing intermediates"
    destination: "/outputs/"
    auto_create: true
    
  scripts:
    pattern: "*.py, *.sh, *.js automation tools"
    destination: "/scripts/"
    subfolder_detection: true
    
  documentation:
    pattern: "permanent docs, principles, knowledge base"
    destination: "/docs/"
    maintain_structure: true

## 🔄 Integration Points

### **Command Integration Pattern**
```markdown
# Standard Command Structure with Zero-Root Verification

## Pre-Execution
- [Standard command setup]

## Execution
- [Command logic]

## Post-Execution (MANDATORY)
1. 🚨 **ZERO-ROOT VERIFICATION**: Execute final zero-root file scan
2. 📁 **STRUCTURE VALIDATION**: Confirm all files in correct locations  
3. ✅ **COMPLIANCE CONFIRMATION**: Verify Principle #81 compliance
4. 📊 **P56 TRANSPARENCY**: Announce verification results
```

### **TodoWrite Integration**
```yaml
todo_completion_verification:
  on_task_complete:
    trigger: "After marking any todo as 'completed'"
    verification: "Execute zero-root file verification"
    announcement: "📋 TASK COMPLETION VERIFIED: Zero-Root Policy maintained"
    
  on_todo_list_update:
    trigger: "After any TodoWrite operation"
    scan: "Check for any new files created during task"
    validate: "Ensure all new files follow Zero-Root Policy"
```

## 🛡️ Violation Prevention System

### **Automated Detection**
```yaml
violation_detection:
  continuous_monitoring:
    scan_frequency: "🚨 REAL-TIME: Every command execution completion with immediate scanning"
    detection_threshold: "🚨 ZERO-TOLERANCE: ANY new file in project root triggers immediate blocking"
    immediate_response: "🚨 AUTOMATIC: Block creation and suggest relocation with mandatory correction"
    
  alert_system:
    p56_announcement: "🚨 ZERO-ROOT VIOLATION DETECTED"
    location_suggestion: "📁 SUGGESTED LOCATION: [appropriate_folder]"
    auto_relocation: "🔄 AUTO-RELOCATING: Moving file to correct location"
    compliance_restored: "✅ COMPLIANCE RESTORED: Zero-Root Policy maintained"
```

### **Automatic Reorganization**
```yaml
auto_reorganization:
  detection_triggers:
    new_file_in_root: "Any file created in root (except permitted)"
    handoff_generation: "HANDOFF_*.md files created anywhere"
    report_generation: "Any *_REPORT.md or analysis files"
    
  relocation_protocol:
    analyze_content: "Analyze file content to determine appropriate location"
    create_folder: "Create target folder if it doesn't exist"
    move_file: "Move file to correct location"
    update_references: "Update any references to moved file"
    confirm_compliance: "🚨 MANDATORY: Confirm Zero-Root Policy compliance with verification audit trail"
    
  enforcement_validation:
    pre_creation_blocking: "🚨 IMMEDIATE: Block any file creation attempt in root before execution"
    real_time_monitoring: "🚨 CONTINUOUS: Monitor all file operations with instant violation detection"
    automatic_correction: "🚨 MANDATORY: Automatically correct violations and relocate files to proper locations"
    compliance_verification: "🚨 REQUIRED: Verify ongoing compliance throughout all operations until convergence"
```
