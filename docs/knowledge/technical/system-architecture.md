# System Architecture - Context Engineering

**Meta-Principle**: "EXECUTE complete system architecture through MANDATORY unified architectural standards"

**Authority Redirect**: Complete system architecture documentation, component relationships, and structural specifications are consolidated in [System Architecture & Performance](./system-architecture-performance.md) for unified architectural standards across all Context Engineering development.

**Purpose**: CRITICAL cross-reference hub for system architecture, MANDATORY structural overview, and component relationships.

## ðŸ”— **Unified System Architecture Standards**

**Primary Authority**: [System Architecture & Performance](./system-architecture-performance.md) - Complete architectural documentation and system structure standards

**Key Architecture Areas Available in Authority Source**:
- **Complete System Architecture** - Hub structure and directory organization
- **Architectural Principles** - Design patterns and structural standards
- **Component Relationships** - System integration and dependencies
- **Performance Architecture** - Optimized structural design
