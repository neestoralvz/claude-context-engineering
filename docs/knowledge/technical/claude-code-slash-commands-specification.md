## üéØ Critical Understanding

### **‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY SPECIFICATION**

**ALL Context Engineering commands are Claude Code slash commands (`/command`) and must NEVER be executed as bash commands.**

This specification prevents critical confusion between:
- **Claude Code slash commands** - AI interface commands that trigger intelligent behaviors
- **Bash scripts** - System automation tools that run in terminal

---

## üìã Technical Distinction

### **Claude Code Slash Commands** (`/command`)

**Execution Context**: Within Claude Code interface
**Syntax**: `/command [parameters]`
**Processing**: Handled by Claude's internal command system
**Purpose**: Trigger specialized AI behaviors and workflows
**File System**: No physical files - exists only in Claude's command registry
**Examples**: `/thinking`, `/execute`, `/containerize`, `/decision`, `/ce`

**Technical Characteristics**:
- **Interface Integration**: Integrated into Claude Code's command processing system
- **Context Awareness**: Full access to conversation context and state
- **AI Orchestration**: Triggers complex AI workflows and behaviors
- **Parameter Handling**: Intelligent parameter processing and validation
- **State Management**: Maintains conversation state across command executions

### **Bash Scripts** (`./script.sh`)

**Execution Context**: Terminal/command line
**Syntax**: `./script.sh [parameters]` or `bash script.sh`
**Processing**: Executed by operating system shell
**Purpose**: Automated system operations and maintenance
**File System**: Physical `.sh` files in `scripts/` directory
**Examples**: `./scripts/validation/validate-system.sh`

**Technical Characteristics**:
- **Shell Integration**: Integrated into operating system shell environment
- **System Access**: Direct access to filesystem and system resources
- **Automation**: Automated system tasks and maintenance operations
- **Environment Variables**: Access to shell environment and system state
- **Process Management**: Can spawn and manage system processes

## ‚ùå INCORRECT Usage Examples

### **Wrong: Treating Slash Commands as Bash Scripts**
```bash
./ce [objective]             # ‚ùå WRONG: /ce is not a bash script
bash /thinking               # ‚ùå WRONG: /thinking is not a bash script
chmod +x /execute            # ‚ùå WRONG: /execute is not a file
sh /containerize my-project  # ‚ùå WRONG: /containerize is not a bash script
ls -la /decision             # ‚ùå WRONG: /decision is not a file
```

### **Wrong: Treating Bash Scripts as Slash Commands**
```markdown
/scripts/validation/validate-system.sh              # ‚ùå WRONG: Not a slash command
/bash scripts/git-workflow/claude-worktree-manager.sh # ‚ùå WRONG: Not a slash command
```

## üö® Common Confusion Points

### **Why This Matters**

**Critical Failures**:
- **Slash commands don't exist as files** - Looking for `/thinking` in filesystem will fail
- **Bash scripts can't be called with `/`** - `/scripts/` syntax doesn't work
- **Different execution environments** - Completely different systems
- **Context requirements** - Slash commands need Claude context, bash scripts need shell

**Warning Signs of Confusion**:
- Attempting to `chmod +x` a slash command
- Looking for slash command files in filesystem
- Expecting slash commands to work in terminal
- Trying to run bash scripts with `/` prefix
- Searching for `/command` files with `find` or `ls`

### **Technical Root Causes**

**Slash Command Confusion**:
- **No Physical Files**: Slash commands exist only in Claude's internal registry
- **Interface-Specific**: Only work within Claude Code interface
- **AI Processing**: Require Claude's AI processing system
- **Context Dependency**: Need conversation context to function

**Bash Script Confusion**:
- **File System Requirement**: Must exist as physical files
- **Shell Dependency**: Require shell environment to execute
- **System Integration**: Need system-level access and permissions
- **Process Management**: Executed as separate system processes

## üí° Quick Identification Guide

### **Identifying Slash Commands**

**If you see `/command`** ‚Üí This is a **Claude Code slash command**
- ‚úÖ Use it within Claude Code interface
- ‚ùå Don't look for it as a file
- ‚ùå Don't try to execute it in terminal
- ‚úÖ Provide parameters directly after command
- ‚úÖ Expect AI-generated responses

**Examples**:
- `/ce analyze-system` ‚Üí Claude Code command
- `/thinking complex-problem` ‚Üí Claude Code command
- `/execute workflow-automation` ‚Üí Claude Code command

### **Identifying Bash Scripts**

**If you see `./scripts/something.sh`** ‚Üí This is a **bash script**
- ‚úÖ Use it in terminal/command line
- ‚úÖ It exists as a physical file
- ‚úÖ Execute with `bash` or `./`
- ‚úÖ Provide shell arguments
- ‚úÖ Expect terminal output

**Examples**:
- `./scripts/validation/validate-system.sh` ‚Üí Bash script
- `bash scripts/git-workflow/claude-worktree-manager.sh` ‚Üí Bash script
- `./scripts/compliance/p55-compliance-check.sh` ‚Üí Bash script

## üéØ Best Practices

### **For Slash Commands**

1. **Always use within Claude Code interface only**
2. **Never attempt to execute as bash scripts**
3. **Provide parameters directly after command**
4. **Expect AI-generated responses and workflows**
5. **Use for triggering AI behaviors and workflows**

### **For Bash Scripts**

1. **Always use in terminal/command line**
2. **Ensure scripts have proper permissions**
3. **Provide shell arguments correctly**
4. **Expect terminal output and system effects**
5. **Use for system automation and maintenance**

### **General Guidelines**

1. **Check the prefix**: `/` = Claude Code, `./` = bash
2. **Check the context**: Claude interface vs terminal
3. **Check the purpose**: AI workflow vs system automation
4. **When in doubt, read the documentation**
5. **Test in appropriate environment**
