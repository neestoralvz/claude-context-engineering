## üîí **SECURITY BY DESIGN RULES (MANDATORY)**

### **1. Pre-Execution Security Validation**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Every command execution MUST include mandatory security validation before any tool call execution.

**Pre-Execution Security Protocol**:

**Credential Scanning Requirements**:
- **MANDATORY Scanning**: API keys, passwords, tokens in all inputs
- **Protection Patterns**: API_KEY, PASSWORD, TOKEN, SECRET, PRIVATE_KEY
- **FORBIDDEN Action**: Exposure in outputs or logs
- **Validation Standard**: 100% detection and protection required

**Data Classification Framework**:
- **Automatic Classification**: Sensitive data types identification
- **Protection Categories**: PII, Financial, Healthcare, Credentials, Business Confidential
- **Accuracy Requirement**: ‚â•95% classification accuracy required
- **Handling Protocol**: Appropriate protection based on classification

**Permission Validation Protocol**:
- **Verification Requirement**: Command execution permissions before sensitive operations
- **Validation Scope**: File system access, network operations, external API calls
- **Enforcement Standard**: 100% permission validation required
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation when permissions insufficient

### **2. Secure Execution Patterns**

**MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION**: All tool calls MUST follow secure execution patterns with isolation and protection.

**Secure Execution Standards**:

**Sandboxed Execution Requirements**:
- **Isolated Environment**: Critical tool calls execution isolation
- **Protection Scope**: File operations, network access, external integrations
- **Isolation Level**: Process-level isolation when possible
- **Monitoring Requirement**: Real-time execution monitoring required

**Data Masking Protocol**:

- **Coverage Scope**: Logs, console outputs, user displays, error messages
- **Protection Effectiveness**: ‚â•99.9% sensitive data protection
- **Functional Preservation**: Output preserved while protecting sensitive data

**Secure Communication Framework**:
- **Encryption Requirement**: Encrypted communication between agents when required
- **Activation Triggers**: Sensitive data transmission, external API calls
- **Security Standards**: TLS 1.3 minimum, end-to-end encryption preferred
- **Validation Protocol**: Certificate validation and secure protocols only

### **3. Security Boundary Enforcement**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Clear security boundaries MUST be enforced between agents, contexts, and data domains.

**Security Boundary Framework**:

**Agent Isolation Requirements**:
- **Security Boundaries**: Between multi-agent executions
- **Implementation Strategy**: Separate execution contexts, isolated memory spaces
- **Communication Control**: Controlled inter-agent communication channels
- **Validation Protocol**: Security boundary integrity validation

**Context Separation Framework**:
- **Isolation Requirement**: Between different user contexts and projects
- **Protection Scope**: User data, project configurations, execution environments
- **Contamination Prevention**: Zero cross-contamination between contexts
- **Monitoring Protocol**: Continuous boundary integrity monitoring

**Data Domain Isolation Framework**:
- **Separation Requirement**: Clear separation between different data sensitivity levels
- **Classification System**: Public, Internal, Confidential, Secret
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automatic enforcement of data handling policies
- **Effectiveness Validation**: Regular validation of data isolation effectiveness
