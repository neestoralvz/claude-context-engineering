# Command Rules System

## Overview

This directory contains the modularized command rules system for the Context Engineering framework. Rules are organized into focused modules for better maintainability and clarity.

## Rule Categories

### üìù Core Writing & Style Rules
- **[writing-standards-rules.md](writing-standards-rules.md)**: Comprehensive writing standards, terminology strategy, and language enforcement for LLM optimization
- **[command-structure-rules.md](command-structure-rules.md)**: Mandatory command structure, auto-activation triggers, and architectural requirements
- **[llm-modularization-rules.md](llm-modularization-rules.md)**: LLM-to-LLM delegation protocols, specialist coordination, and modular intelligence distribution

### üå≥ Decision & Coordination Rules
- **[decision-coordination-rules.md](decision-coordination-rules.md)**: Decision trees with Mermaid, tool coordination patterns, and systematic decision-making protocols
- **[philosophy-optimization-rules.md](philosophy-optimization-rules.md)**: Philosophical foundations, optimization strategies, and continuous improvement protocols
- **[validation-metrics-rules.md](validation-metrics-rules.md)**: Validation protocols, mathematical precision, and performance measurement standards

### üéØ Core Execution Rules
- **[execution-rules.md](execution-rules.md)**: Core command execution protocols and requirements
- **[meta-command-rules.md](meta-command-rules.md)**: Meta-command behavioral rules and orchestration protocols
- **[tool-call-rules.md](tool-call-rules.md)**: Tool call execution protocols and requirements

### üõ°Ô∏è Compliance Rules
- **[p55-p56-compliance.md](p55-p56-compliance.md)**: P55/P56 compliance validation rules
- **[content-deduplication-rules.md](content-deduplication-rules.md)**: Content deduplication and cross-reference optimization rules

### üîß Technical Rules
- **[script-integration-rules.md](script-integration-rules.md)**: Script system integration requirements

### üé® User Experience Rules
- **[visual-announcement-rules.md](visual-announcement-rules.md)**: Visual announcement protocols for P56 compliance

## Usage

Each rule module is designed to be:
- **Self-contained**: Can be referenced independently
- **Modular**: Can be imported into specific commands or contexts
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update and modify
- **Testable**: Clear validation criteria

## Integration

Rules are integrated into the Context Engineering system through:
- Direct references in command definitions
- Validation protocols in execution frameworks
- Compliance checkers in automation scripts
- Documentation generation for user guides

## Maintenance

Rules should be updated when:
- New compliance requirements are introduced
- Execution patterns change
- Technical standards evolve
- User experience improvements are needed
