# Visual Announcement Rules - Context Engineering

**Meta-Principle**: "Complete transparency through systematic visual communication"

**Authority Redirect**: Complete visual announcement rules, P56 compliance standards, and user interface transparency protocols are consolidated in [Execution & Integration Standards](./execution-integration-standards.md) for unified implementation across all Context Engineering commands.

**Purpose**: MANDATORY cross-reference hub for visual announcement rules, P56 transparency standards, and systematic communication protocols.

## ðŸ“Š **MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY PROTOCOLS (MANDATORY)**

### **System Observability Visual Standards**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All monitoring operations MUST include visual transparency for complete system observability.

**Integration Reference**: [Transparent System Observability Principle](../principles/operational-excellence.md#63-transparent-system-observability)

```yaml
observability_visual_framework:
  real_time_monitoring_announcements:
    requirement: "MANDATORY visual announcements for all monitoring operations"
    scope: "System health, performance metrics, resource utilization, error detection"
    format: "Real-time visual dashboards with comprehensive status indicators"
    frequency: "â‰¤30 second update intervals for critical monitoring"
    
  performance_metrics_display:
    requirement: "Visual display of all performance metrics with transparency"
    metrics: "Response time, throughput, error rate, resource utilization"
    presentation: "Real-time charts, graphs, and numerical displays"
    accuracy: "â‰¥95% metric accuracy with 4-decimal precision where applicable"
    
  alert_visualization:
