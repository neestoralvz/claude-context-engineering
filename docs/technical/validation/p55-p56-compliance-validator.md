# P55/P56 Compliance Validator

## Overview

**Automated validation system** for Principle #55 (Tool Call Execution Bridging) and Principle #56 (Command Execution Transparency) compliance, specifically focusing on the bidirectional communication requirements between Task agents and Principal agent.

**Purpose**: Ensure all Task agent deployments follow the enhanced communication protocol and maintain transparency standards.
