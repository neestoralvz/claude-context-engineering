# Context Engineering Universal Meta-Command (Compliant Copy)

**Reference**: Based on [Original Context-Eng Command](./context-eng.md) with full compliance to [Command Rules System](../../../docs/command-rules/README.md)

## Command: `/context-eng-compliant` (aliases: `/cec`, `/compliant-context-engineering`, `/meta-compliant`)

**Meta-Principle**: "Enable models through structured context, not control."

MANDATORY compliant meta-orchestrator that dynamically discovers and utilizes ALL available Context Engineering commands for 100x developer productivity. Automatically detects command ecosystem size, selects optimal commands, and chains execution based on task complexity, confidence levels, and real-time registry state with REQUIRED full compliance to all command rules.

**Enhanced Compliance Integration**: Complete implementation of [P55/P56 Compliance Rules](../../../docs/command-rules/p55-p56-compliance.md), [Tool Call Execution Rules](../../../docs/command-rules/tool-call-rules.md), and [Meta-Command Behavioral Rules](../../../docs/command-rules/meta-command-rules.md).
