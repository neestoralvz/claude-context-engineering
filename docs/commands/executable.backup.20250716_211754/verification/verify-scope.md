## üìä **MATHEMATICAL VALIDATION**

### **Comprehensive Quality Score**
```javascript

  const functional_quality = assessFunctionalQuality(execution_results)
  const visual_quality = assessVisualQuality(execution_results)
  const performance_quality = assessPerformanceQuality(execution_results)
  const behavioral_quality = assessBehavioralQuality(execution_results)
  const security_quality = assessSecurityQuality(execution_results)
  
  return {
    overall_score: (functional_quality * 0.3 + visual_quality * 0.2 + 
                   performance_quality * 0.2 + behavioral_quality * 0.2 + 
                   security_quality * 0.1),
    dimension_scores: {
      functional: functional_quality,
      visual: visual_quality,
      performance: performance_quality,
      behavioral: behavioral_quality,
      security: security_quality
    }
  }
}
```

### **Verification Coverage Assessment**
```javascript
function assessVerificationCoverage(verification_results) {
  const coverage_dimensions = ['functional', 'visual', 'performance', 'behavioral', 'security']
  const covered_dimensions = verification_results.dimensions.length
  const depth_score = calculateVerificationDepth(verification_results)
  
  return {
    coverage_percentage: (covered_dimensions / coverage_dimensions.length) * 100,
    depth_score: depth_score,
    liberation_effectiveness: (coverage_percentage * depth_score) / 100
  }
}
// Required: ‚â• 0.9 (90% coverage with high depth)
```
