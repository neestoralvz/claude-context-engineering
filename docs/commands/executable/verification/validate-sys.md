- **Documentation Currency**: **REQUIRED** ‚â§7 days (from living documentation)
- **Pattern Recognition**: **MANDATORY** ‚â•85% (from pattern crystallization)
- **Complexity Compliance**: **CRITICAL** Atomic ‚â§1.0, Module ‚â§1.5, Orchestrator ‚â§2.0

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL

### Step 1: System Scan

**System Element Scanning Process**:
- **Commands Directory**: Check all commands in .claude/commands/ directory against established thresholds
- **Templates Directory**: Scan templates directory for compliance and quality standards
- **Documentation System**: Verify documentation in docs/ and core files for currency and accuracy
- **Registry Data**: Validate command-registry.json for consistency and completeness

**Scanning Results**: Comprehensive system element validation across commands, templates, documentation, and registry data for complete system integrity assessment.

### Step 2: Threshold Validation

**Threshold Validation Process**:
- **Confidence Scoring**: Use existing confidence scoring algorithms for element assessment
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Apply threshold enforcement protocols for compliance verification
- **Mathematical Verification**: Check mathematical verification requirements for precision
- **Pattern Crystallization**: Validate pattern crystallization criteria for quality assurance

**Validation Results**: Mathematical threshold validation with confidence scoring, enforcement protocols, verification requirements, and pattern crystallization for comprehensive quality assurance.

### Step 3: Violation Detection

**Violation Detection Process**:
- **Principle Identification**: Identify which specific principle is violated
- **Element Analysis**: Determine specific element causing the violation
- **Severity Assessment**: Evaluate severity level of violation impact
- **Integrity Impact**: Assess impact on overall system integrity

**Detection Results**: Comprehensive violation detection with principle identification, element analysis, severity assessment, and integrity impact evaluation for targeted remediation.

### Step 4: Auto-Remediation Suggestions

**Remediation Suggestion Process**:
- **Command Recommendation**: Suggest exact command to fix identified issue
- **Implementation Steps**: Provide detailed implementation steps for correction
- **Pattern Documentation**: Document violation pattern for future prevention
- **Workflow Integration**: Integrate correction into existing workflow processes

**Remediation Results**: Specific corrective action recommendations with command suggestions, implementation guidance, pattern documentation, and workflow integration for effective system integrity restoration.

## üí° MAINTENANCE PHILOSOPHY

This command embodies the Context Engineering principle of "Enable, Don't Control" by:

1. **Using Existing Tools**: Leverages established verification systems
2. **Avoiding Feature Creep**: No new complexity, only organization
3. **Maintaining Simplicity**: Simple checks with clear remediation
4. **Preserving Autonomy**: Suggests solutions, doesn't force changes
5. **Learning from Patterns**: Improves prevention through experience

The system maintains integrity through intelligent use of existing mechanisms, ensuring all 43 principles work together harmoniously without adding unnecessary complexity.
