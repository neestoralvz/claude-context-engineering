## üîß P55 Script Execution Protocol

**MANDATORY**: This command automatically executes tool call validation and execution verification scripts:

```bash
# Core tool call validation and compliance
./scripts/validation/validate-tool-call-compliance.sh --execution-validation
./scripts/compliance/enhanced-p55-p56-monitor.sh --tool-call-monitoring

# Execution analysis and simulation detection
./scripts/validation/analyze-simulation-prevention.sh --simulation-detection
./scripts/core/execute-commands.sh --tool-call-verification
```

## ‚ö° Command Execution

### **Input Format**
```markdown
/validate-tool-call-execution [execution_data?] [compliance_thresholds?] [statistical_requirements?]
```

### **Unique P55 Validation Process**
1. **Data Collection**: **REQUIRED** gather execution history via tool calls with ‚â•90% completeness
2. **Pattern Analysis**: **MANDATORY** identify tool call vs simulation patterns with statistical precision
3. **Statistical Calculation**: **CRITICAL** apply mathematical validation formulas with ‚â•95% accuracy
4. **Zero Tolerance Enforcement**: **MANDATORY** immediate compliance remediation with automatic enforcement
5. **Evidence Generation**: **REQUIRED** complete execution traceability with real-time monitoring

### **Specialized Statistical Compliance Thresholds**

The P55 validation specialization provides unique statistical compliance requirements:

```markdown
üìä STATISTICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

- Tool Call Execution Rate: ‚â•80% (actions use real tool calls)
- Real Work Ratio: ‚â•70% (execution vs advice)
- Script Execution Rate: ‚â•95% (referenced scripts actually run)
- Statistical Confidence: ‚â•95% (detection accuracy)
- Simulation Tolerance: 0% (zero tolerance enforcement)

Compliance Status: [PASSED/FAILED]
Remediation Required: [YES/NO]
```

### **Unique Zero Tolerance Enforcement Protocol**

The command specializes in immediate compliance enforcement:

```markdown
üõ°Ô∏è ZERO TOLERANCE ENFORCEMENT

Simulation Detection: [ACTIVE/INACTIVE]
- Pattern Analysis: Real-time scanning for simulation language
- Immediate Flagging: Instant detection of non-compliance
- Automatic Remediation: Compliance restoration protocols
