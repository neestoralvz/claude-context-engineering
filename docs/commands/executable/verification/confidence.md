## 📋 Usage Examples

### **API Endpoint Confidence Scoring**
- **/Confidence-Scoring {Functional**: 0.95, visual: 0.0, performance: 0.88, behavioral: 0.82} "backend_api" "production
**Result**: Overall confidence 9.1/10, exceeds production threshold (9.0), ready for deployment

### **UI Component Confidence Scoring**
- **/Confidence-Scoring {Functional**: 0.85, visual: 0.92, performance: 0.78, behavioral: 0.88} "ui_component" "development
**Result**: Overall confidence 8.7/10, meets development threshold (8.0), proceed with testing

### **Performance Critical Feature**
- **/Confidence-Scoring {Functional**: 0.90, visual: 0.70, performance: 0.95, behavioral: 0.85} "performance_critical" "production
**Result**: Overall confidence 9.2/10, exceeds high-performance threshold (9.0), deployment approved

### **Specialized Auto-Restart Integration**

The confidence scoring command provides unique auto-restart functionality with escalation management:

```markdown
🔄 AUTO-RESTART LOOP EXECUTION

Iteration [1-3]: CONFIDENCE VALIDATION
- Current Confidence: [score]/10
- Adaptive Threshold: [threshold]/10
- Status: [PASSED/FAILED]
- [Si PASSED → CONTINUE TO MONITORING]
- [Si FAILED → REFINE AND RESTART]

Routing Refinement:
- Feedback Generated: [feedback_details]
- Decision-Engine Refinement: [REQUESTED/COMPLETED]
- New Routing Decision: [refined_command]

Loop Result:
- Success: [YES/NO]
- Iterations Used: [count]/3
- Monitoring Active: [YES/NO]
- Escalation Required: [YES/NO]
```

**AUTO-RESTART PROTOCOL**:
1. **Max 3 iterations** to prevent infinite loops
2. **Each iteration**: Calculate confidence → validate threshold → refine if failed
3. **Success condition**: confidence >= threshold
4. **Escalation**: After 3 failed attempts
5. **Always activate**: trigger-monitor when successful

### **Context-Aware Weight Optimization**

**Weight Optimization Process**:

**Base Weight Selection**:
- Select contextual weights based on task context
- Apply general weights as fallback for unknown contexts
- Ensure weight distribution matches task requirements

**Performance History Analysis**:
- Analyze historical performance data for context
- Identify performance patterns and trends
- Calculate performance adjustments based on history

**Optimization Results**:
- **Optimized Weights**: Apply performance adjustments to base weights
- **Confidence Boost**: Calculate confidence enhancement from adjustments
- **Weight Explanation**: Generate reasoning for weight selection and adjustments

**Context Optimization**: Enhanced weight optimization with performance history integration, confidence boost calculation, and explanatory reasoning for transparent weight selection.

### **Dynamic Threshold Categories**
- **Production Critical**: 9.5 threshold (maximum reliability required)
- **High Priority**: 9.0 threshold (critical business functionality)  
- **Medium Priority**: 8.5 threshold (standard quality gates)
