## ðŸŽ¯ **Command Execution Protocol**

### **ðŸš¨ AUTOMATIC Dashboard Activation**

```yaml
compliance_dashboard_activation:
  command_trigger: "/compliance-dashboard"
  execution_mode: "immediate_activation"
  
  dashboard_initialization:
    real_time_monitoring: "Activate principle activation status monitoring"
    compliance_tracking: "Initialize compliance score tracking (target: â‰¥95%)"
    enforcement_monitoring: "Enable blocking success rate monitoring"
    alert_systems: "Activate critical alert and trend monitoring"
    
  monitoring_components:
    principle_activation_panel: "Real-time activation status and latency tracking"
    compliance_monitoring_panel: "Tier-based compliance monitoring with violation tracking"
    enforcement_effectiveness_panel: "Blocking and correction success rate monitoring"
    predictive_analytics_panel: "Trend analysis and optimization recommendations"
    
  performance_requirements:
    update_frequency: "â‰¤100ms real-time updates"
    alert_response: "â‰¤30 second critical alert response"
    performance_overhead: "â‰¤5% system performance impact"
    dashboard_availability: "99.9% uptime requirement"
```

### **Real-Time Monitoring Interface**

The dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of:

1. **Principle Activation Status**:
   - Currently active principles (real-time counter)
   - Activation frequency by principle (heatmap)
   - Activation latency tracking (target: â‰¤100ms)
   - Coverage completeness gauge (target: â‰¥95%)

2. **Compliance Monitoring**:
   - Overall compliance score (large percentage display)
   - Tier-based compliance breakdown (red/yellow/blue indicators)
   - Violation trend analysis (24-hour window)
   - Resolution time histogram (target: â‰¤5 minutes)

3. **Enforcement Effectiveness**:
   - Blocking success rate gauge (target: â‰¥95%)
   - Correction effectiveness matrix
   - Behavioral compliance tracking
   - Enforcement trend analysis (7-day window)

4. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - Compliance trend predictions
   - Violation probability forecasting
   - Optimization opportunity identification
   - System health scoring

### **Alert System Integration**

```yaml
alert_configuration:
  critical_alerts:
    tier_1_violations: "Immediate blocking with system alerts"
    enforcement_failures: "System integrity alerts with automatic recovery"
    activation_failures: "Principle activation system failure alerts"
    
  warning_alerts:
    compliance_degradation: "Trend alerts for declining compliance"
    performance_impact: "Performance degradation alerts"
    optimization_opportunities: "Proactive optimization recommendations"
    
  notification_channels:
    dashboard_display: "Visual alerts on monitoring interface"
    system_logs: "Comprehensive logging for audit trails"
    automated_responses: "Automatic resolution attempts where possible"
```
