# Orchestrator Command: `/execution-workflow`

## **Workflow Orchestrator: Parallel Execution with Verification**
**Combines Principles #10, #11, #12: Parallel > Sequential + Verification Loops + Enable Don't Control**

---

## üéØ **ORCHESTRATOR DEFINITION**

### **Purpose**
Coordinate autonomous parallel execution of planned objectives with continuous verification loops and minimal control intervention, maximizing speed and quality through intelligent orchestration.

### **Complexity**: 1.5/1.5
### **Context Required**: Planning results and execution parameters
### **Execution Time**: Variable (depends on objective complexity and parallelization)

### **Inheritance Architecture**
```yaml
inherits_from:
  universal_meta_core: true        # Script integration, monitoring, reporting, triggers, learning
  core_orchestration_hub: true     # Workflow coordination, progress tracking, error handling
  
unique_functions:
  five_phase_execution: true       # Core execution workflow phases
  parallel_deployment: true       # Parallelization strategy implementation
  autonomous_enablement: true     # AI autonomy calibration
  verification_orchestration: true # Continuous verification loops
  progress_documentation: true    # Strategic checkpoint management
  pattern_capture: true          # Execution pattern recognition
```

## ‚ö° **UNIQUE ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL**

### **Input Format**
```
/execution-workflow [execution_plan] [parallelization_level?] [verification_frequency?]
```

### **5-Phase Execution Core**
```javascript
function executeExecutionWorkflow(execution_plan, parallelization_level, verification_frequency) {
  const parallel_execution = await deployParallelExecution(execution_plan.sub_objectives)
  const autonomy_calibration = await enableAutonomousOperation(parallel_execution)
  const verification_cycles = await orchestrateVerification(execution_plan.verification_plan)
  const execution_checkpoints = await documentExecutionProgress(parallel_execution)
  const execution_patterns = await captureExecutionPatterns(execution_checkpoints)
  
  return orchestrateExecutionResults(parallel_execution, verification_cycles, execution_patterns)
}
```

**Note**: This orchestrator implements the unique core of parallel execution coordination with autonomous operation and continuous verification. Universal functions (script integration, monitoring, reporting, triggers, learning) and orchestration hub functions (workflow coordination, progress tracking, error handling) are inherited from parent architectures, maintaining 100% functionality while achieving ~78% size reduction through inheritance-based optimization.
