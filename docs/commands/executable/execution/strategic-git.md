## 🔍 **VERIFICATION CRITERIA**

### **Success Metrics**
- **Checkpoint Coverage**: ≥95% of significant development stages have commits
- **Message Quality**: All commit messages clearly describe changes and rationale
- **Recovery Capability**: ≥100% ability to return to any development decision point
- **Progress Visibility**: Development progress clearly trackable through commit history
- **Collaboration Support**: Team members can understand development progression

### **Mathematical Validation**

**CRITICAL Strategic Git Effectiveness Calculation** (Natural Language Implementation):

**Effectiveness Components**:
- **Checkpoint Coverage**: 30% weight - percentage of development stages with commits
- **Message Quality**: 25% weight - quality of commit messages and rationale
- **Recovery Capability**: 25% weight - ability to return to any development decision point
- **Progress Visibility**: 15% weight - clarity of development progress through commit history
- **Collaboration Support**: 5% weight - team understanding of development progression

**Calculation Formula**:
- **Strategic Git Effectiveness** = (Checkpoint Coverage × 0.30) + (Message Quality × 0.25) + (Recovery Capability × 0.25) + (Progress Visibility × 0.15) + (Collaboration Support × 0.05)
- **Required Threshold**: ≥ 8.5/10

**Success Criteria**: Strategic Git effectiveness must achieve 8.5 or higher on a 10-point scale
