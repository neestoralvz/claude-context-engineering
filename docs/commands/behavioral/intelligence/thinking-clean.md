# Atomic Command: `/progressive-thinking`

## **Principle #22: Progressive Intelligence Framework**
**"Execute complete progressive thinking sequence for deep strategic analysis and breakthrough insights."**

---

## üéØ **COMMAND DEFINITION**

### **Purpose**
Execute the complete progressive thinking sequence (Think ‚Üí Think More ‚Üí Think Harder ‚Üí Ultra Think) as a reusable module that any command can invoke to add deep strategic analysis capabilities.

### **Complexity**: 0.9/1.0
### **Context Required**: Analysis context or prompt requiring deep thinking
### **Execution Time**: 60-180 seconds (depending on complexity and input context)

## ‚ö° **ACTIVATION PROTOCOL**

### **Input Format**
```
/progressive-thinking [context] [focus_area?] [depth_requirements?]
```

### **What This Command Does**
1. **Stage 1 - Contextual Think**: Initial understanding enriched by available context
2. **Stage 2 - Analytical Think**: Deep analysis leveraging all gathered intelligence  
3. **Stage 3 - Strategic Think**: Strategic optimization with practical implementation details
4. **Stage 4 - Breakthrough Think**: Revolutionary insights and innovative approaches
5. **Synthesis Integration**: Combine all thinking stages into actionable strategic intelligence

### **Mandatory Requirements**
- **Complete Sequence**: Always execute all 4 thinking stages
- **Progressive Depth**: Each stage builds meaningfully on previous insights
- **Context Integration**: Leverage provided context throughout progression
- **Strategic Output**: Generate actionable strategic intelligence

    focus: "Strategic execution planning with practical implementation details"
    process: "Design concrete strategic implementation with specific coordination"
    input: "Strategic analysis + Available tools/commands + Context constraints"
    output: "Executable strategic implementation plan with coordination strategy"
    
  stage_4_breakthrough_think:
    focus: "Revolutionary insights and comprehensive verification strategy"
    process: "Generate breakthrough insights and define verification approach"
    input: "Implementation plan + Strategic objectives + Innovation requirements"
    output: "Breakthrough insights + Comprehensive verification framework"
```

### **Synthesis Protocol**
- **Context Optimization**: Optimize context utilization across all thinking stages
- **Insight Integration**: Combine insights across stages for breakthrough solutions  
- **Strategic Coordination**: Design optimal coordination strategy based on progression
