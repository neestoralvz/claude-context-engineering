## 🔍 **VERIFICATION CRITERIA**

### **Success Metrics**
- **Variation Quality**: ≥85% of variations viable for testing
- **Selection Accuracy**: ≥90% correlation between predicted and actual success
- **Evolution Progress**: Each iteration ≥10% improvement over previous
- **Pattern Recognition**: Successful patterns documented for reuse

### **Mathematical Validation**
```javascript
evolution_effectiveness = (
  (variation_quality * 0.3) +
  (selection_accuracy * 0.4) +
  (evolution_progress * 0.2) +
  (pattern_reuse * 0.1)
)
// Required: ≥ 8.5/10
```

## 🔗 **NATURAL CONNECTIONS**

### **Automatically Triggers**
- `/recognize-patterns` - Identify successful patterns for replication
- `/verification-loops` - Test variations against criteria
- `/living-documentation` - Document evolutionary learnings

### **Compatible With**
- `/parallel-over-sequential` - Run variations simultaneously
- `/tdd` - Define selection criteria upfront
- `/objective-decomposition` - Evolve solutions for sub-objectives

### **Feeds Into**
- Pattern crystallization (successful evolutions become commands)
- Knowledge hierarchy (evolutionary learnings become organizational knowledge)
- Decision engine optimization (successful patterns inform routing)

---

## 📋 **USAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Algorithm Optimization**
```text
/evolve-intelligence "Optimize database query performance" 5 "response_time < 50ms"
```
**Result**: AI generates 5 different optimization approaches, tests each, evolves best combination

### **Architecture Design**
```text
/evolve-intelligence "Design scalable microservices architecture"
```
**Result**: AI creates multiple architectural variations, evaluates trade-offs, evolves optimal design

### **Problem Solving**
```text
/evolve-intelligence "Reduce memory usage in image processing pipeline" 4
```
**Result**: AI explores 4 different memory optimization strategies, evolves hybrid solution

---

## 🛡️ **FALLBACK PROTOCOL**

### **If Command Fails**
1. **Insufficient Variations**: Reduce variation count to 3, focus on quality
2. **Poor Selection Criteria**: Automatically trigger `/tdd` for better criteria
3. **No Evolution Progress**: Manually analyze variations, adjust selection logic
4. **Pattern Recognition Failure**: Document attempted approaches for future analysis

### **Recovery Strategy**
- Maintain variation logs for learning from failures
- Fall back to single best approach if evolution stalls
- Use simplified selection criteria if complex criteria fail
- Create baseline for future evolutionary improvements

---

## 📊 **INTEGRATION WITH DECISION ENGINE**

### **Confidence-Based Routing**
- **High Confidence Objective (≥90%)**: Standard 3-variation evolution
- **Medium Confidence (75-90%)**: Extended 5-variation evolution with deeper analysis
- **Low Confidence (<75%)**: Mandatory `/exploration-first` before evolution
- **Complex Objectives**: Chain with `/objective-decomposition` for sub-evolution

### **Pattern Recognition**
- Successful variation patterns → Crystallization into specialized commands
- Evolution strategies that consistently work → Template evolution approaches
- Failed evolution attempts → Improved variation generation
- Selection criteria effectiveness → Better criteria templates

---

## 🔄 **EVOLUTION TRACKING**

### **Learning Metrics**
- **Variation Success Rate**: % of generated variations that prove viable
- **Evolution Velocity**: Speed of improvement across iterations
- **Pattern Emergence**: Rate of discovering reusable patterns
- **Selection Accuracy**: Correlation between predicted and actual success

### **Evolutionary Intelligence Growth**
- Track which variation strategies work best for different objective types
- Learn optimal variation counts for different complexity levels
- Identify successful combination patterns across evolutions
- Build organizational intelligence about what approaches evolve well

---

## 🎯 **EVOLUTIONARY BENEFITS**

### **Compound Intelligence**
- **First Use**: Learn basic variation and selection
- **Repeated Use**: Apply learned patterns for faster evolution
- **Domain Expertise**: Domain-specific evolutionary strategies
- **Pattern Mastery**: Predictable evolution in well-understood areas

### **Natural Improvement**
