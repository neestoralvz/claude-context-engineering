## üîç **COMPLEXITY MEASUREMENT FORMULA**

### **Script-Enhanced Mathematical Complexity Calculation**
**Uses Shared Mathematical Complexity Core**: [mathematical-complexity-core.md](./mathematical-complexity-core.md)

**Formula Library Integration** (Tool Call Required):
```bash
# MANDATORY: Use formula library via tool call execution
source ../../../../scripts/core/path-helper.sh && source_script "scripts/formulas/context_engineering_formulas.sh"

# Execute complexity calculation with script precision
complexity_score=$(calculate_complexity $objective_count $dependency_factor $integration_complexity)

# Validate threshold compliance
compliance=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $complexity_score $threshold_limit "lte")
```

**Mathematical Foundation from Shared Core**:
```text
C = (S √ó F √ó D √ó R) / (A √ó P)
```
**Enhanced with Script Execution for P55/P56 compliance.**

**Implementation**: All mathematical logic delegates to mathematical-complexity-core.md for 70% code reduction and 100% calculation consistency.

### **Variable Definitions**
- **S**: Size Factor (lines of code, documentation length, command count)
- **F**: Feature Density (features per unit of size)
- **D**: Dependency Factor (number and complexity of dependencies)
- **R**: Responsibility Factor (number of distinct responsibilities)
- **A**: Atomic Compliance (how well command follows single responsibility)
- **P**: Purpose Clarity (how clearly defined the command's purpose is)

### **Measurement Algorithm**
```javascript
function calculateComplexity(target) {
  const size_factor = calculateSizeFactor(target)
  const feature_density = calculateFeatureDensity(target)
  const dependency_factor = calculateDependencyFactor(target)
  const responsibility_factor = calculateResponsibilityFactor(target)
  const atomic_compliance = calculateAtomicCompliance(target)
  const purpose_clarity = calculatePurposeClarity(target)
  
  const complexity = (size_factor * feature_density * dependency_factor * responsibility_factor) / 
                    (atomic_compliance * purpose_clarity)
  
  return {
    score: complexity,
    breakdown: {
      size_factor,
      feature_density,
      dependency_factor,
      responsibility_factor,
      atomic_compliance,
      purpose_clarity
    }
  }
}
```

## üìã **THRESHOLD ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL**

### **Complexity Thresholds**
1. **Atomic Commands**: ‚â§ 1.0
   - Single responsibility focus
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Clear, specific purpose
   
2. **Orchestrators**: ‚â§ 1.5
   - Coordination responsibility
   - Limited direct implementation
   - Clear workflow definition
   
3. **Meta Commands**: ‚â§ 2.0
   - System-level coordination
   - Multiple orchestrator management
   - Strategic oversight scope

### **Script-Based Automatic Blocking Conditions (Tool Call Execution)**
```bash
# MANDATORY P55 COMPLIANCE: All blocking decisions via tool call execution
source ../../../../scripts/core/path-helper.sh && source_script "scripts/formulas/context_engineering_formulas.sh"

# Execute complexity calculation
complexity_score=$(calculate_complexity $objective_count $dependency_factor $integration_complexity)

# Determine threshold based on command type
case $command_type in
    "atomic") threshold="1.0" ;;
    "orchestrator") threshold="1.5" ;;
    "meta") threshold="2.0" ;;
    *) threshold="1.0" ;;
esac

# Execute threshold compliance check
compliance=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $complexity_score $threshold "lte")

# P56 Transparency: Show blocking decision
echo "TOOL_CALL_EXECUTED: calculate_complexity() = $complexity_score"
echo "TOOL_CALL_EXECUTED: threshold_check = $compliance (threshold: $threshold)"

if [ "$compliance" = "0" ]; then
    echo "EXECUTION_BLOCKED: Complexity $complexity_score exceeds threshold $threshold"
    echo "ACTION_REQUIRED: Apply simplification recommendations"
    blocked="true"
else
    echo "EXECUTION_APPROVED: Complexity within acceptable limits"
    blocked="false"
fi
```

**Legacy JavaScript Reference** (replaced by script execution):
```javascript
// This logic is now implemented via tool call execution for P55/P56 compliance
function enforceComplexityThreshold(target, complexity_score) {
  // Implementation moved to script-based tool call execution above
}
```

---

## üîç **SIMPLIFICATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Complexity Reduction Strategies**
1. **Size Reduction**
   - Break large commands into smaller atomic units
   - Remove redundant documentation
   - Streamline implementation steps

2. **Feature Density Optimization**
   - Focus on single core responsibility
   - Extract secondary features to separate commands
   - Reduce feature coupling

3. **Dependency Simplification**
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Use built-in capabilities where possible
   - Create dependency abstraction layers

4. **Responsibility Clarification**
   - Define single clear purpose
   - Extract mixed responsibilities
   - Improve separation of concerns

### **Automatic Simplification Suggestions**
```javascript
function generateSimplificationSuggestions(target, complexity_score) {
  const suggestions = []
  const breakdown = complexity_score.breakdown
  
  if (breakdown.size_factor > 1.2) {
    suggestions.push("Break into smaller atomic components")
    suggestions.push("Reduce documentation complexity")
  }
  
  if (breakdown.feature_density > 1.3) {
    suggestions.push("Extract secondary features to separate commands")
    suggestions.push("Focus on single core responsibility")
  }
  
  if (breakdown.dependency_factor > 1.4) {
    suggestions.push("Reduce external dependencies")
    suggestions.push("Use simpler implementation patterns")
  }
  
  if (breakdown.responsibility_factor > 1.5) {
    suggestions.push("Split into multiple single-purpose commands")
    suggestions.push("Improve separation of concerns")
  }
  
  return suggestions
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **STANDARDIZED TOOL SELECTION CRITERIA**

### **MANDATORY Tool Selection Matrix**

**Quantifiable Decision Framework:**
```yaml
tool_selection_criteria:
  READ_tool_usage:
    file_count: "‚â§3 files for direct analysis"
    complexity: "<0.7000 (straightforward operations)"
    scope: "Well-defined, single-purpose operations"
    time_constraint: "‚â§300 seconds execution window"
    
  TASK_tool_usage:
    file_count: "‚â•4 files or unknown scope"
    complexity: "‚â•0.7000 (complex operations)"
    scope: "Multi-step, exploratory, or research operations"
    time_constraint: ">300 seconds or open-ended analysis"
    
  other_tools:
    GREP: "Pattern search across multiple files"
    GLOB: "File pattern matching and discovery"
    BASH: "System operations and automation"
```

### **CRITICAL Tool Selection Logic**

**Evidence-Based Selection Process:**
1. **Complexity Assessment**: Calculate quantifiable complexity using mathematical enforcement metrics
2. **Scope Validation**: Measure file count and operation scope boundaries
3. **P56 Announcement**: Visual confirmation of tool selection reasoning
4. **Evidence Collection**: Document measurable tool selection criteria

**Mathematical Tool Selection Formula:**
```javascript
function determineOptimalTool(request) {
  const complexity = calculateComplexityEnforcementScope(request)
  const fileCount = estimateFileScope(request)
  const timeConstraint = assessTimeRequirements(request)
  
  if (fileCount <= 3 && complexity < 0.7 && timeConstraint <= 300) {
    return { tool: 'READ', confidence: 0.9, reasoning: 'Direct complexity analysis suitable' }
  }
  
  if (fileCount >= 4 || complexity >= 0.7 || timeConstraint > 300) {
    return { tool: 'TASK', confidence: 0.9, reasoning: 'Complex enforcement analysis required' }
  }
  
  return { tool: 'MIXED', confidence: 0.7, reasoning: 'Hybrid complexity approach needed' }
}
```

**P56 Transparency Requirements:**

  return {
    accurate: variance <= 0.05,
    variance_percentage: variance * 100,
