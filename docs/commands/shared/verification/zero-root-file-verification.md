## üéØ Command Function

**PRIMARY PURPOSE**: Provide standardized Zero-Root File verification that can be integrated into ANY command that creates, moves, or manages files.

**INTEGRATION METHOD**: Add verification call at the end of any command execution pipeline with automatic P56 transparency announcements.

---

## üìã Command Specification

### **Core Verification Function**
```yaml
zero_root_file_verification:
  command_name: "zero-root-verify"
  priority: "MAXIMUM"
  execution_phase: "post-action"
  integration_type: "shared_component"
  
  verification_steps:
    1_root_scan: "Scan project root directory for unauthorized files"
    2_exception_check: "Verify only CLAUDE.md and README.md present in root"
    3_violation_detection: "Identify any files violating Zero-Root Policy"
    4_automatic_resolution: "Auto-relocate violations to appropriate folders"
    5_compliance_confirmation: "Confirm complete Zero-Root Policy compliance"
    6_transparency_announcement: "P56 announcement of verification results"
```

### **Integration Pattern**
```markdown
# Standard Integration in Any Command

## Command Execution
[Standard command logic here]

## MANDATORY Post-Execution (Add to ALL file-generating commands)
```bash
# Zero-Root File Verification (MANDATORY)
echo "üö® ZERO-ROOT VERIFICATION: Executing final file structure validation..."
zero-root-verify --post-action --transparency
```

### Command completes with Zero-Root Policy compliance confirmed
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Verification Algorithm

### **Detection Logic**
```yaml
verification_algorithm:
  root_directory_scan:
    target: "project_root_directory"
    permitted_files: ["CLAUDE.md", "README.md"]
    scan_method: "comprehensive_file_enumeration"
    hidden_files: "include_in_scan"
    
  violation_classification:
    handoff_files: "HANDOFF_*.md ‚Üí relocate to /handoffs/"
    report_files: "*_REPORT.md, *_ANALYSIS.md ‚Üí relocate to /reports/"
    output_files: "temporary results ‚Üí relocate to /outputs/"
    script_files: "*.py, *.sh, *.js ‚Üí relocate to /scripts/"
    documentation: "*.md docs ‚Üí relocate to appropriate /docs/ subfolder"
    
  automatic_resolution:
    folder_creation: "Create target folders if they don't exist"
    file_relocation: "Move files to appropriate locations"
    reference_updates: "Update any broken references after moves"
    compliance_validation: "Re-verify zero violations after resolution"
```

### **P56 Transparency Framework**
```yaml
transparency_announcements:
  verification_start:
    message: "üö® ZERO-ROOT VERIFICATION: Analyzing project structure for compliance..."
    detail_level: "high"
    timing: "immediate"
    
  scan_results:
    compliant: "‚úÖ COMPLIANCE VERIFIED: Zero-Root File Policy maintained"
    violations_found: "‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATIONS DETECTED: [count] files require relocation"
    processing: "üîÑ AUTO-RELOCATING: Moving files to appropriate locations"
    
  resolution_complete:
    success: "‚úÖ COMPLIANCE RESTORED: All files properly organized"
    locations: "üìÅ FILES RELOCATED: [file] ‚Üí [destination]"
    final_status: "üõ°Ô∏è ZERO-ROOT POLICY: 100% compliance achieved"
```

## üîÑ Command Integration Targets

### **High-Priority Commands (MANDATORY Integration)**
```yaml
critical_integration:
  documentation_commands:
    - "/sync-docs": "Verify no temp files in root after documentation sync"
    - "/update-living-docs": "Ensure living docs properly placed in /docs/"
    - "/handoff": "Force HANDOFF_*.md to /handoffs/ directory"
    
  analysis_commands:
    - "/verify-flow": "Output validation reports to /reports/"
    - "/mathematical-verification": "Results to /outputs/ or /reports/"
    - "/validate-system": "Compliance reports to /reports/"
    - "/orchestrate": "Verify all generated orchestration files"
    
  file_generation:
    - "Write tool usage": "Pre-validate target path compliance"
    - "TodoWrite completion": "Trigger verification on task completion"
    - "Any file creation": "Post-execution verification mandatory"
```

### **Integration Implementation**
```bash
# Example Integration in Documentation Command
/sync-docs() {
    # Standard sync-docs logic
    execute_documentation_sync
    
    # MANDATORY Zero-Root Verification (Principle #81)
    echo "üö® ZERO-ROOT VERIFICATION: Validating file structure compliance..."
    zero-root-verify --command="sync-docs" --transparency --auto-resolve
    
    # Command completion with compliance confirmed
    echo "‚úÖ SYNC-DOCS COMPLETE: All files properly organized"
}
```
