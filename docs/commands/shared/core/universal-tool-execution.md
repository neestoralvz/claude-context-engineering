## ⚡ **P55/P56 Compliance Protocol**

### **Principle #55: Tool Call Execution Transparency**
**MANDATORY**: All mathematical operations, file operations, and system interactions MUST use visible tool calls, never simulation or description.

```yaml
p55_compliance_requirements:
  tool_call_execution:
    mathematical_operations: "MANDATORY tool calls for all calculations"
    file_operations: "MANDATORY tool calls for all file read/write/edit operations"
    system_interactions: "MANDATORY tool calls for all bash commands and scripts"
    evidence_collection: "MANDATORY tool calls for all data gathering"
    
  prohibited_actions:
    simulation: "NEVER simulate tool calls or describe what would happen"
    assumption: "NEVER assume tool call results without actual execution"
    description: "NEVER describe tool call outcomes without real execution"
    placeholders: "NEVER use placeholder values instead of real calculations"
```

### **Principle #56: Visual Execution Transparency**
**MANDATORY**: All command executions MUST provide visual announcements and progress tracking for user awareness.

```yaml
p56_visual_requirements:
  command_initialization:
    visual_announcement: "Clear command execution announcement with context"
    expected_duration: "Estimated execution time and complexity"
    tools_required: "List of tools that will be used"
    priority_level: "Execution priority and importance"
    
  progress_visibility:
    phase_announcements: "Visual progress through execution phases"
    tool_activity: "Real-time tool usage indicators"
    milestone_completion: "Clear milestone achievement notifications"
    completion_summary: "Final execution results and outcomes"
```
