```

### **Task Tool Coordination**

#### Multi-Agent Deployment
```markdown
◉ 3 Task agents → Research + Analysis + Validation [deploying]
⟳ Agent coordination → Parallel execution → Dependency detection active
✓ 3 agents ready → Coverage: codebase + patterns + compliance
```

#### Agent Status Updates
```markdown
✓ Agent 1 → Notification patterns identified (72 scripts analyzed)
⟳ Agent 2 → Command structure analysis 60% complete
⚠ Agent 3 → Validation issues found → Details required
```

#### Consolidated Results
```markdown
✓ 3 agents → Results merged → Pattern analysis complete [5.7s]
📊 72scripts 16modules 12authorities → 85% optimization opportunities identified
```

## 🔧 Conversation Functions

### **cn_claude_status()** - Claude Operation Status
```bash
# Usage in Claude responses (mental framework)
cn_claude_status "process" "codebase analysis" "72 scripts found" "2.8s"
# Output: ⟳ Codebase analysis → 72 scripts found (2.8s)

cn_claude_status "ok" "implementation" "system ready" "1.2s"  
# Output: ✓ Implementation → system ready (1.2s)
```

### **cn_claude_progress()** - Multi-Phase Operations
```bash
cn_claude_progress 3 5 60 "validation phase"
# Output: Phase 3/5 ██████░░░░ 60% validation phase
```

### **cn_claude_agents()** - Task Tool Coordination
```bash
cn_claude_agents 3 "Research + Analysis + Validation" "active"
# Output: ◉ 3 agents → Research + Analysis + Validation [active]
```

### **cn_claude_workflow()** - Command Chaining
```bash
cn_claude_workflow "/discover → /analyze → /execute" "ready"
# Output: ⟳ Chain: /discover → /analyze → /execute → Ready for execution
```

### **cn_claude_summary()** - Operation Completion
```bash
cn_claude_summary 12 3 1 "4.2s" 85
# Output: ✓12 ⚠3 ✗1 [4.2s] 85% efficiency
```

## 📊 Communication Patterns by Context

### **System Activation Context**
```markdown
User: "Activate the complete context engineering system"

❌ VERBOSE:
"I'll activate the Context Engineering system for you. This involves loading all 76 commands, scanning the knowledge base, and preparing the meta-orchestration capabilities. Let me start by checking the command registry..."

✅ COMPACT:
⟳ /context-eng → Registry scan → ✓ 76cmd loaded [1.8s]
```

### **Complex Analysis Context**
```markdown
User: "Analyze the notification system and find improvement opportunities"

❌ VERBOSE:
"I'll analyze your notification system comprehensively. First, I'll scan through all the scripts to understand current patterns, then examine the documentation for consistency, and finally identify specific areas for improvement..."

✅ COMPACT:
◉ 3 Task agents → Scripts + Docs + Patterns [analyzing]
```

### **Implementation Context**
```markdown
User: "Implement the compact notification improvements"

❌ VERBOSE:
"I'll implement the compact notification improvements by creating the necessary files, establishing standards, and migrating existing scripts to use the new patterns..."

✅ COMPACT:
⟳ Implementation → Library + Standards + Migration [progress tracking]
```

### **Validation Context**
```markdown
User: "Verify the system integrity after changes"

❌ VERBOSE:
"I'll run a comprehensive validation to check system integrity. This includes verifying command functionality, checking cross-references, validating mathematical formulas, and ensuring compliance..."

✅ COMPACT:
⟳ /verify-flow → ✓ Commands ✓ Math ⚠ Links ✗ Compliance [3.4s] → Fix needed
```

## 🚀 Advanced Patterns

### **Progressive Disclosure**
```markdown
# Initial compact response
✓ Analysis complete → 72scripts optimized → 70% verbosity reduced

# Detail available on request
Details: 156→28 chars (P56 validation), 89→45 chars (progress), 203→29 chars (summary)
```

### **Contextual Awareness**
```markdown
# Automatically adapts based on operation complexity
Simple: ✓ file.md created
Complex: ⟳ Multi-phase → Phase 3/5 ██████░░░░ 60% → Agent coordination active
```

### **Error Recovery Patterns**
```markdown
✗ validation.sh:42 TypeError → Auto-retry 2/3 → ✓ Fixed [0.8s]
⚠ 3 warnings found → Manual review recommended → Continue? (Y/n)
```

### **Dependency Chain Visualization**
```markdown
⟳ Chain: /discover → /analyze → /execute → /verify → /report
     ✓        ✓         ⟳         ⚪         ⚪
```

## 📋 Implementation Guidelines

### **Response Structure Rules**

1. **Opening Line**: Direct action status (no preamble)
2. **Progress Line**: Visual indicator for complex operations  
3. **Result Line**: Outcome with next action clear
4. **Details**: Available on-demand only

### **Symbol Usage Standards**

- **⟳** Process in progress, active work
- **✓** Successful completion, positive outcome
- **✗** Error, failure, critical issue  
- **⚠** Warning, attention needed, caution
- **◉** Active agents, running processes
- **ℹ** Information, neutral status

### **Timing Integration**

- **Include timing** for operations >1 second
- **Format consistently**: [N.Ns] for seconds, [NmNs] for minutes
- **Skip timing** for instant operations
- **Estimate timing** for complex multi-phase operations

### **Context Preservation**

- **Essential info only** in compact format
- **Details available** via follow-up questions
- **Links preserved** for documentation references
- **Full verbosity** available via explicit request

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### **Phase 1: Internal Adoption**
- Apply compact patterns in Claude responses
- Use mental cn_* function framework
- Maintain information completeness

### **Phase 2: User Experience**

### **Phase 3: System Integration**
- Meta-command enhancement
- Task tool coordination optimization
- Validation workflow compaction

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
- Contextual response adaptation
- Predictive progress indication
- Intelligent detail management
