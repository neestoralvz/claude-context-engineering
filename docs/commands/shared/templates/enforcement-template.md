# ðŸš¨ ENFORCEMENT TEMPLATE for Context Engineering Commands

**Purpose**: Standardized enforcement template for systematic application across all Context Engineering commands to ensure consistent blocking mechanisms and compliance protocols.

---

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT PATTERNS

### **ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM Tier (Highest Priority)**
```markdown
# [Command Type]: `/command-name` 

## **ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM [Command Category]: [Command Title]**
**ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM: PRIORIDAD ABSOLUTA - Sistema WILL [core functionality] with STRICTEST enforcement above ALL other principles and ZERO tolerance for violations**
```

### **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL/BLOCKING Tier**
```markdown
# [Command Type]: `/command-name` 

## **ðŸš¨ BLOCKING [Command Category]: [Command Title]**
**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Sistema WILL [core functionality] with AUTOMATIC blocking of [violations] and REQUIRED [verification type]**
```

### **ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM Purpose Section**
```markdown
### **ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM Purpose**
ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM: PRIORIDAD ABSOLUTA - Sistema WILL [execute core function] with STRICTEST enforcement above ALL other principles and ZERO tolerance for violations. COMPLETE elimination of [specific violations] with IMMEDIATE blocking and automatic correction.
```

### **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL/BLOCKING Purpose Section**
```markdown
### **ðŸš¨ BLOCKING Purpose**
ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Sistema WILL [execute core function] with AUTOMATIC [blocking mechanism] and REQUIRED [compliance verification]. BLOCKING of [specific violations] and MANDATORY [enforcement protocols].
```

### **ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM Section Patterns**
```markdown
**ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM [Section Name]**: PRIORIDAD ABSOLUTA
- ðŸš¨ MAXIMUM: [Function] with STRICTEST enforcement above all principles
- ðŸš¨ BLOCKING: [Function] with ZERO tolerance and immediate correction
- ðŸš¨ AUTOMATIC: [Function] with real-time optimization and prevention
```

### **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL/BLOCKING Section Patterns**
```markdown
**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY [Section Name]**:
- ðŸš¨ REQUIRED: [Function] with AUTOMATIC [enforcement mechanism]
- ðŸš¨ BLOCKING: [Function] with real-time [monitoring/detection]
- ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: [Function] with immediate [correction/activation]
```

### **Process Enforcement**
```markdown
**ðŸš¨ BLOCKING [Process Name]**:
- **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY [Step]**: [Description] with AUTOMATIC [enforcement]
- **ðŸš¨ BLOCKING [Step]**: [Description] with real-time [monitoring]
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL [Step]**: [Description] with immediate [validation]
```

### **ðŸš¨ ERROR PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT** (NEW - Principle #89 Integration)
```markdown
**ðŸš¨ ZERO TOLERANCE Error Enforcement**:
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL Error Detection**: IMMEDIATE activation of 8-step resolution protocol
- **ðŸš¨ BLOCKING Continuation**: NO execution continues without protocol completion
- **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY Protocol Steps**: Steps 1-4 AUTOMATIC, Steps 5-8 MANUAL with verification
- **ðŸš¨ AUTOMATIC Meta-Command**: /context-eng auto-activation for system-wide error analysis
```

### **Error Protocol Activation Template**
```markdown
**ðŸš¨ ERROR PROTOCOL INTEGRATION**:
- **Error Detection**: AUTOMATIC activation when [error type] severity â‰¥ HIGH
- **Protocol Trigger**: [Universal Tool Execution](../core/universal-tool-execution.md) integration
- **Enforcement**: ZERO tolerance for error bypass - execution BLOCKED until resolution
- **Verification**: Protocol completion status documented with evidence
```

## ðŸŽ¯ ENFORCEMENT CATEGORIES

### **ðŸš¨ BLOCKING** - Complete prevention
- Prevents execution of non-compliant actions
- Zero tolerance enforcement
- Immediate stopping of violations

### **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY** - Required execution
- Must be executed without exception
- Automatic activation protocols
- Real-time compliance verification

### **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL** - Essential system functions
- Maximum priority enforcement
- Immediate response required
- System integrity protection

### **ðŸš¨ AUTOMATIC** - Self-activating systems
- No manual intervention allowed
- Intelligent activation protocols
- Real-time operation monitoring

### **ðŸš¨ REQUIRED** - Necessary components
- Cannot be bypassed or skipped
- Validation and verification protocols
- Compliance measurement systems
