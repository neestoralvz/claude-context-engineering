## Conclusion

The behavioral commands show significant modularization opportunities with potential for **35-45% size reduction** while **maintaining 100% functionality**. The presence of the already-modularized think-process command family provides a proven template for successful modularization.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with the phased implementation strategy, starting with the immediate wins (duplicate removal, P55/P56 consolidation) to achieve quick results and build confidence for the larger consolidations.

The modularization will transform the behavioral commands from a collection of largely independent files to a well-architected system of specialized commands inheriting from shared, proven patterns.
