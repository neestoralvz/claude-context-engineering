## üöÄ ADAPTIVE INTELLIGENT ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

This system adapts execution based on task complexity and context, automatically selecting optimal approaches for different scenarios.

### **üéØ Strategy Selection**

**Intelligent Scaling** reduces overhead by [X]% for simple tasks:

```yaml
adaptive_[strategy]_selection:
  simple_tasks_complexity_‚â§_[threshold]:
    [strategy]: ["[Step 1]", "[Step 2]"] 
    duration: "[time] ([X]% faster)"
    criteria: 
      - [criterion_1]
      - [criterion_2]
      - [criterion_3]
    optimization: "[optimization description]"
    
  medium_tasks_complexity_[range]:
    [strategy]: ["[Step 1]", "[Step 2]", "[Step 3]"]
    duration: "[time] ([X]% faster)" 
    criteria:
      - [criterion_1]
      - [criterion_2]
      - [criterion_3]
    optimization: "[optimization description]"
    
  complex_tasks_complexity_‚â•_[threshold]:
    [strategy]: ["[All Steps]"]
    duration: "[time] (full power)"
    criteria:
      - [criterion_1]
      - [criterion_2]
      - [criterion_3]
    optimization: "[optimization description]"

adaptive_triggers:

    condition: "[escalation condition]"
    action: "[escalation action]"
    
  [optimization_name]:
    condition: "[optimization condition]"
    action: "[optimization action]"
```

### **üîç Analysis Detection**

**Pre-execution analysis** determines optimal configuration:

```javascript
function determineConfiguration(objective, context) {
  const complexity_estimate = estimateTaskComplexity(objective)
  const confidence_score = assessObjectiveClarity(objective)
  const scope_analysis = analyzeScopeIndicators(objective)
  
  // Simple Task Pattern
  if (complexity_estimate <= [threshold] && 
      confidence_score >= [threshold] && 
      scope_analysis.[condition]) {
    return {
      configuration: "simple_[type]",
      [strategy]: ["[steps]"],
      estimated_time: "[time]",
      optimization: "[optimization description]"
    }
  }
  
  // Medium Task Pattern  
  if (complexity_estimate <= [threshold] && 
      confidence_score >= [threshold]) {
    return {
      configuration: "medium_[type]", 
      [strategy]: ["[steps]"],
      estimated_time: "[time]",
      optimization: "[optimization description]"
    }
  }
  
  // Complex Task Pattern
  return {
    configuration: "complex_[type]",
    [strategy]: ["[all steps]"],
    estimated_time: "[time]", 
    optimization: "[optimization description]"
  }
}
```

## üß† **Learning Engine (Optional)**

```yaml
learned_routing_targets:
  [pattern_1]:
    command: "/[target-command]" 
    triggers: ["[trigger1]", "[trigger2]", "[trigger3]"]
    confidence_threshold: [threshold]
    success_rate: "tracked automatically"
    
  [pattern_2]:
    command: "/[target-command]"
    triggers: ["[trigger1]", "[trigger2]", "[trigger3]"]
    confidence_threshold: [threshold]
    success_rate: "tracked automatically"
    
  [pattern_3]:
    command: "/[target-command]"
    triggers: ["[trigger1]", "[trigger2]", "[trigger3]"]
    confidence_threshold: [threshold]
    success_rate: "tracked automatically"
    
  full_orchestration:
    command: "standard /[command-name] execution"
    triggers: ["[complex triggers]"]
    confidence_threshold: [threshold]
    success_rate: "tracked automatically"
```

## üîÑ **Command Registry Integration**

### **Command Discovery and Selection**

This command features intelligent command discovery that analyzes the current registry state:

```yaml

  auto_discovery:
    registry_scan: "Real-time scan of command-registry.json to detect relevant commands"
    command_counting: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM relevant_categories for dynamic sizing"
    adaptive_scaling: "Automatically adjust thresholds based on detected ecosystem size"
    
  ecosystem_categories:
    [category_1]: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [category_1]"
    [category_2]: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [category_2]"
    [category_3]: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [category_3]"
    total_ecosystem_size: "SUM(relevant_categories) = DYNAMIC_TOTAL"
    
  adaptive_thresholds:
    [threshold_1]: "MIN([value], [percentage]% of total_ecosystem_size)"

## üéØ **MANDATORY EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS (Principle #56)**

### **MANDATORY TOOL CALL PROTOCOL**

**CRITICAL**: When this command executes any tool call, the system MUST display a visual announcement before executing the tool.

**MANDATORY EXECUTION REQUIREMENT**: Every action that mentions deployment, execution, or activation REQUIRES an actual tool call. Simulation is FORBIDDEN - real tool calls are MANDATORY.

4. **CRITICAL Agent Deployment**: When deploying agents, MUST show deployment announcement
5. **MANDATORY Status Display**: MUST show agent status updates as they occur
6. **CRITICAL Progress Monitoring**: MUST display real-time progress from all deployed agents
7. **MANDATORY Completion Reporting**: MUST show completion announcement with results
8. **CRITICAL Error Transparency**: MUST surface failures immediately with recovery actions
9. **MANDATORY Communication Maintenance**: MUST maintain and display communication channel status
