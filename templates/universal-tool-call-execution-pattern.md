# Universal Tool Call Execution Pattern for Context Engineering Commands

## **Meta-Principle**: "Real Tool Execution + Complete Transparency + Mathematical Foundation"

**Universal Enforcement**: Every Context Engineering command MUST implement this tool call execution pattern to ensure P55/P56 compliance, mathematical rigor, and complete user transparency.

## 🎯 **UNIVERSAL TOOL CALL EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

### **Core Execution Principle**
**NO SIMULATION ALLOWED**: All Context Engineering commands MUST execute real tool calls. Simulation, description, or estimation is prohibited. Users must see actual tool execution results.

### **Universal Tool Categories and Usage**

    usage: "Script execution, mathematical calculations, system validation"
    triggers: ["mathematical operations", "script execution", "system validation"]
    announcement_type: "Mathematical Script Execution"
    evidence_required: "Actual script outputs with numerical results"
