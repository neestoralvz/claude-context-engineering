```
/complexity-enforcement [target] [threshold_override?] [action?]
```

### **What This Command Does (Script-Enhanced with Tool Call Execution)**
1. **Complexity Measurement**: Calculate mathematical complexity score using formula library via tool calls
2. **Script-Based Threshold Application**: Apply complexity limits using calculate_complexity() function

## 🔍 **COMPLEXITY MEASUREMENT FORMULA**

### **Script-Enhanced Mathematical Complexity Calculation**
**Formula Library Integration** (Tool Call Required):
```bash
# MANDATORY: Use formula library via tool call execution
source /scripts/formulas/context_engineering_formulas.sh

# Execute complexity calculation with script precision
complexity_score=$(calculate_complexity $objective_count $dependency_factor $integration_complexity)

# Validate threshold compliance
compliance=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $complexity_score $threshold_limit "lte")
```

**Original Mathematical Foundation**:
```
C = (S × F × D × R) / (A × P)
```
**Enhanced with Script Execution for P55/P56 compliance.**

### **Variable Definitions**
- **S**: Size Factor (lines of code, documentation length, command count)
- **F**: Feature Density (features per unit of size)
- **D**: Dependency Factor (number and complexity of dependencies)
- **R**: Responsibility Factor (number of distinct responsibilities)
- **A**: Atomic Compliance (how well command follows single responsibility)
- **P**: Purpose Clarity (how clearly defined the command's purpose is)

### **Measurement Algorithm**
```javascript
function calculateComplexity(target) {
  const size_factor = calculateSizeFactor(target)
  const feature_density = calculateFeatureDensity(target)
  const dependency_factor = calculateDependencyFactor(target)
  const responsibility_factor = calculateResponsibilityFactor(target)
  const atomic_compliance = calculateAtomicCompliance(target)
  const purpose_clarity = calculatePurposeClarity(target)
  
  const complexity = (size_factor * feature_density * dependency_factor * responsibility_factor) / 
                    (atomic_compliance * purpose_clarity)
  
  return {
    score: complexity,
    breakdown: {
      size_factor,
      feature_density,
      dependency_factor,
      responsibility_factor,
      atomic_compliance,
      purpose_clarity
    }
  }
}
```

## 📋 **THRESHOLD ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL**

### **Complexity Thresholds**
1. **Atomic Commands**: ≤ 1.0
   - Single responsibility focus
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Clear, specific purpose
   
2. **Orchestrators**: ≤ 1.5
   - Coordination responsibility
   - Limited direct implementation
   - Clear workflow definition
   
3. **Meta Commands**: ≤ 2.0
   - System-level coordination
   - Multiple orchestrator management
   - Strategic oversight scope

### **Script-Based Automatic Blocking Conditions (Tool Call Execution)**
```bash
# MANDATORY P55 COMPLIANCE: All blocking decisions via tool call execution
source /scripts/formulas/context_engineering_formulas.sh

# Execute complexity calculation
complexity_score=$(calculate_complexity $objective_count $dependency_factor $integration_complexity)

# Determine threshold based on command type
case $command_type in
    "atomic") threshold="1.0" ;;
    "orchestrator") threshold="1.5" ;;
    "meta") threshold="2.0" ;;
    *) threshold="1.0" ;;
esac

# Execute threshold compliance check
compliance=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $complexity_score $threshold "lte")

# P56 Transparency: Show blocking decision
echo "TOOL_CALL_EXECUTED: calculate_complexity() = $complexity_score"
echo "TOOL_CALL_EXECUTED: threshold_check = $compliance (threshold: $threshold)"

if [ "$compliance" = "0" ]; then
    echo "EXECUTION_BLOCKED: Complexity $complexity_score exceeds threshold $threshold"
    echo "ACTION_REQUIRED: Apply simplification recommendations"
    blocked="true"
else
    echo "EXECUTION_APPROVED: Complexity within acceptable limits"
    blocked="false"
fi
```

**Legacy JavaScript Reference** (replaced by script execution):
```javascript
// This logic is now implemented via tool call execution for P55/P56 compliance
function enforceComplexityThreshold(target, complexity_score) {
  // Implementation moved to script-based tool call execution above
}
```

## 🔍 **SIMPLIFICATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Complexity Reduction Strategies**
1. **Size Reduction**
   - Break large commands into smaller atomic units
   - Remove redundant documentation
   - Streamline implementation steps

2. **Feature Density Optimization**
   - Focus on single core responsibility
   - Extract secondary features to separate commands
   - Reduce feature coupling

3. **Dependency Simplification**
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Use built-in capabilities where possible
   - Create dependency abstraction layers

4. **Responsibility Clarification**
   - Define single clear purpose
   - Extract mixed responsibilities
   - Improve separation of concerns

### **Automatic Simplification Suggestions**
```javascript
function generateSimplificationSuggestions(target, complexity_score) {
  const suggestions = []
  const breakdown = complexity_score.breakdown
  
  if (breakdown.size_factor > 1.2) {
    suggestions.push("Break into smaller atomic components")
    suggestions.push("Reduce documentation complexity")
  }
  
  if (breakdown.feature_density > 1.3) {
    suggestions.push("Extract secondary features to separate commands")
    suggestions.push("Focus on single core responsibility")
  }
  
  if (breakdown.dependency_factor > 1.4) {
    suggestions.push("Reduce external dependencies")
    suggestions.push("Use simpler implementation patterns")
  }
  
  if (breakdown.responsibility_factor > 1.5) {
    suggestions.push("Split into multiple single-purpose commands")
    suggestions.push("Improve separation of concerns")
  }
  
  return suggestions
}
```

## 🔍 **SCRIPT-VALIDATED VERIFICATION CRITERIA**

### **Script-Based Success Metrics (Tool Call Validation)**
```bash
# MANDATORY: All success metrics validated via script tool calls
source /scripts/formulas/context_engineering_formulas.sh

# Calculate compliance rate
compliance_rate=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $commands_passed $total_commands "gte")

# Validate blocking effectiveness (must be 100%)
blocking_effectiveness=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $violations_prevented $total_violations "eq")

# Check simplification success rate
simplification_success=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $successful_simplifications $flagged_commands "gte")

# Validate monitoring accuracy
accuracy_check=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $measurement_variance "0.05" "lte")

# P56 Transparency: Display all validation results
echo "SCRIPT_VALIDATION_RESULTS:"
echo "  compliance_rate = $compliance_rate (target: >=95%)"
echo "  blocking_effectiveness = $blocking_effectiveness (target: 100%)"
echo "  simplification_success = $simplification_success (target: >=90%)"
echo "  monitoring_accuracy = $accuracy_check (variance: <=5%)"
```

**Enhanced Success Metrics**:
- **Compliance Rate**: ≥95% (script-validated via calculate_threshold_compliance)
- **Blocking Effectiveness**: 100% (script-validated, zero tolerance for violations)
- **Simplification Success**: ≥90% (script-tracked and validated)
- **Monitoring Accuracy**: Complexity measurements within ±5% variance (script-validated)

### **Measurement Validation**
```javascript
function validateComplexityMeasurement(target, calculated_score) {
  const manual_review_score = conductManualComplexityReview(target)
  const variance = Math.abs(calculated_score - manual_review_score) / manual_review_score
  
  return {
    accurate: variance <= 0.05,
    variance_percentage: variance * 100,
    requires_calibration: variance > 0.05
  }
}
```

## 📚 **CONTINUOUS MONITORING PROTOCOL**

### **Evolution Tracking**
```javascript
function monitorComplexityEvolution(target) {
  const current_complexity = calculateComplexity(target)
  const historical_complexity = getComplexityHistory(target.id)
  
  const trend = analyzeComplexityTrend(historical_complexity)
  
  if (trend.direction === 'increasing' && trend.rate > 0.1) {
    return {
      alert: true,
      message: "Complexity increasing beyond acceptable rate",
      action_required: "Review and simplify implementation"
    }
  }
  
  return { alert: false, trend: trend }
}
```
