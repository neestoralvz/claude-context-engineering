# Decision Category - Routing, Orchestration, and Selection Commands

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This category contains commands that handle **decision-making**, **routing**, **orchestration**, and **selection logic** within the Context Engineering system. These commands determine what to execute next, how to coordinate complex workflows, and which approaches to take.

## ðŸŽ¯ Category Purpose

**Decision commands** are the **nervous system** of the Context Engineering ecosystem. They:
- **Route** requests to appropriate commands based on complexity and confidence
- **Orchestrate** complex multi-command workflows
- **Select** optimal approaches, models, and strategies
- **Coordinate** specialist agents and parallel execution

## ðŸ”§ Commands in This Category

### **Core Decision Engine**
- **`decision.md`** - Mathematical routing brain that determines execution strategy
- **`explicit-decision-trees.md`** - Binary decision mapping with mathematical triggers

### **Orchestration Commands**  
- **`orchestrate.md`** - Dynamic command coordination and intelligent routing
- **`discover.md`** - Discovery workflow orchestration (moved from orquestadores)
- **`command-relationships.md`** - Command dependency mapping and coordination

### **Selection Commands**
- **`model-selection.md`** - AI model routing decisions (Opus/Sonnet selection)
- **`multi-agent-orchestration.md`** - Agent deployment decisions and coordination

## ðŸŽ­ Functional Characteristics

### **Decision Logic**
- Mathematical triggers and thresholds
- Confidence-based routing algorithms

## ðŸ”— Integration with Other Categories

### **Receives Input From:**
- **operacionales/** - Task requirements and execution context
- **comportamiento/** - System state and monitoring data
- **meta/** - Universal activation requests

### **Provides Output To:**
- **orquestadores/** - Workflow execution instructions
- **operacionales/** - Specific command execution requests
- **comportamiento/** - System behavior modifications

## ðŸŒŸ Key Benefits of This Category

### **Eliminates Redundancy**
- Consolidates decision logic from multiple categories
- Reduces 30-50% overlap in routing algorithms
- Creates single source of truth for decision-making

### **Improves Maintainability**
- Clear separation of decision concerns
- Easier to update routing logic
- Centralized orchestration intelligence

### **Enhances Scalability**
- New decision commands can be added easily
- Routing logic can evolve independently
- Orchestration patterns can be reused

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Patterns

### **Direct Decision Making**
```bash
/decision "complex task analysis"
/explicit-decision-trees "binary routing decision"
```

### **Orchestration Workflows**
```bash
/orchestrate "multi-command coordination"
/discover "knowledge discovery workflow"
```

### **Selection Operations**
```bash
/model-selection "task complexity assessment"
/multi-agent-orchestration "specialist deployment"
```

## ðŸ”„ Evolution and Crystallization

This category represents the **crystallization** of routing patterns identified through system analysis. Commands here:
- Evolved from scattered decision logic
