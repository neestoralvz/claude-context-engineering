## üîó Integration Patterns

### **Command Flow**
1. **Routing** ‚Üí **Selection** ‚Üí **Orchestration** ‚Üí **Execution** ‚Üí **Verification** ‚Üí **Documentation**
2. **Intelligence** and **Exploration** support all phases
3. **Behavior** monitors and adapts throughout
4. **Optimization** continuously improves performance

- Intelligence drives exploration and autonomous behavior
- Verification ensures quality at every step
- Documentation captures patterns for future reuse

## üéØ Benefits of Functional Organization

### **Intuitive Navigation**
- Find related commands easily
- Understand command relationships
- Discover relevant functionality faster

### **Clear Boundaries**
- Each category has distinct responsibility
- Reduced confusion about command purpose
- Easier to maintain and extend

### **Functional Cohesion**
- Commands grouped by what they do
- Related functionality in same location
- Natural workflow patterns emerge

## üöÄ Usage Guidelines

### **Finding Commands**
1. Identify what you want to accomplish
2. Go to the relevant functional category
3. Browse available commands in that category

### **Understanding Relationships**
- Check `mapping/command-relationships.md` for detailed connections
- Each category README explains internal relationships
- Natural workflow patterns documented

### **Contributing New Commands**
1. Determine primary function of new command
2. Place in appropriate functional category
3. Update category README with new command
4. Document relationships in mapping category

## üìä Migration from Previous Structure

### **Previous Structure (Taxonomic)**
- `operacionales/` ‚Üí Distributed across functional categories
- `orquestadores/` ‚Üí Mainly to `orchestration/`
- `comportamiento/` ‚Üí Mainly to `behavior/`
- `meta/` ‚Üí Preserved as `meta/`
- `decision/` ‚Üí Distributed across `core-routing/`, `orchestration/`, `selection/`, `mapping/`

### **New Structure (Functional)**
- Organization by what commands do
- Clear separation of concerns
- Natural workflow patterns
- Intuitive navigation
