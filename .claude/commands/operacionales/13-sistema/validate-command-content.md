## 🎯 **MANDATORY LLM BEHAVIORAL INSTRUCTIONS (Principle #56)**

### **Tool Call Execution Protocol - REQUIRED BEHAVIOR**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: When this command executes ANY Tool Call (Bash, Read, Edit, Task, etc.), the LLM MUST display the enhanced visual announcement from Principle #56 BEFORE executing the tool.

**EXPLICIT TOOL CALL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT**: Every action described in the phase protocols that mentions "Execute script", "Load command", or "Deploy" REQUIRES an actual tool call execution. The LLM MUST NEVER simulate these actions - real tool calls are mandatory.

### **Implementation Requirements - MANDATORY**

**TOOL CALL EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **Pre-Tool Call Announcement**: ALWAYS display visual announcement before ANY tool execution
2. **MANDATORY BASH TOOL EXECUTION**: When any phase protocol states "Execute script", the LLM MUST execute a tool call using the Bash tool
3. **MANDATORY READ TOOL EXECUTION**: When any phase protocol states "Load command", the LLM MUST execute a tool call using the Read tool
4. **REAL EXECUTION ONLY**: NEVER simulate or describe what would happen - ALWAYS execute actual tool calls
5. **Script Execution Announcement**: When executing validation scripts, show enhanced Bash execution announcement
6. **Command Loading Announcement**: When loading validation commands, show enhanced Read execution announcement
7. **Progress Monitoring**: Display real-time progress from all executed tools
8. **Completion Reporting**: Always show completion announcement with comprehensive results
9. **Error Handling Transparency**: Surface any failures immediately with recovery actions

**TOOL CALL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**:
- Each mention of "action:" in phase protocols REQUIRES tool call execution
- Every "bash_executions_required:" REQUIRES Bash tool call
- All "read_executions_required:" REQUIRE Read tool call execution
- NO EXCEPTIONS: Simulation is prohibited, only real tool execution allowed

### **Compliance Enforcement - CRITICAL**

- **NEVER skip announcements**: Every tool call must have visual announcement
- **NEVER simulate script execution**: All Bash tool calls must be real execution
- **NEVER simulate command loading**: All Read tool calls must be real execution
- **ALWAYS display progress**: Users must see tool execution status
- **ALWAYS show results**: Display actual output from tool execution

**Compliance Validation**: This command integrates P55/P56 Compliance Validator throughout execution to ensure 100% compliance with Tool Call Execution Bridging and Command Execution Transparency requirements.
