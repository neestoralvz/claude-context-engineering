## üå≥ **WORKTREE ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL**

### **Worktree Creation Strategy**
```bash
# Primary approaches (up to 5 worktrees)
git worktree add ../approach-1-[strategy_name] [base_branch]
git worktree add ../approach-2-[strategy_name] [base_branch]
git worktree add ../approach-3-[strategy_name] [base_branch]
git worktree add ../approach-4-[strategy_name] [base_branch]
git worktree add ../approach-5-[strategy_name] [base_branch]
```

### **Approach Categorization**
- **Approach 1**: Conservative/proven patterns
- **Approach 2**: Performance-optimized solution
- **Approach 3**: Developer experience focused
- **Approach 4**: Scalability/future-proof design
- **Approach 5**: Experimental/cutting-edge techniques

### **Worktree Management**
```javascript
function manageWorktrees(approaches) {
  return approaches.map(approach => ({
    path: `../approach-${approach.id}-${approach.strategy}`,
    branch: `feature/approach-${approach.id}`,
    focus: approach.optimization_target,
    verification_criteria: approach.success_metrics,
    development_status: 'active'
  }))
}
```

1. **No Cross-Contamination**: Each worktree develops independently
2. **Consistent Problem Scope**: Same requirements across all approaches
3. **Standardized Verification**: Apply identical success criteria
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor development velocity per approach
5. **Documentation Standards**: Document decisions and trade-offs

### **Parallel Development Workflow**
```javascript
function executeParallelDevelopment(worktrees) {
  return worktrees.map(worktree => ({
    implementation_strategy: defineStrategy(worktree.focus),
    development_approach: worktree.methodology,
    verification_protocol: standardVerificationCriteria,
    progress_tracking: realTimeProgressMonitoring,
    decision_documentation: captureDesignDecisions
  }))
}
```

### **Cross-Approach Coordination**
- **Shared Requirements**: Consistent problem definition
- **Independent Implementation**: No solution cross-pollination
- **Parallel Verification**: Simultaneous testing approaches
- **Objective Measurement**: Standardized success metrics

## üîó **BEST ELEMENTS MERGING STRATEGY**

### **Synthesis Protocol**
1. **Identify Strengths**: Extract best aspects from each approach
2. **Analyze Trade-offs**: Understand why each approach excels
3. **Design Hybrid**: Combine optimal elements strategically
4. **Validate Integration**: Ensure merged elements work together
5. **Preserve Learnings**: Document insights from all approaches

### **Element Extraction Framework**
```javascript
function extractBestElements(evaluatedApproaches) {
  const best_elements = {
    performance_optimizations: findBestPerformanceFeatures(evaluatedApproaches),

3. **Resource Constraints**: Reduce to 2-3 most promising approaches
4. **Evaluation Complexity**: Simplify comparison criteria to essential metrics

### **Worktree Management Issues**

## üìä **INTEGRATION WITH DECISION ENGINE**

### **Confidence Routing**
- **High Approach Clarity**: Immediate worktree creation for identified strategies
- **Medium Clarity**: Start with 2-3 approaches, expand based on initial results
- **Low Clarity**: Begin with exploration-first to identify viable approaches
- **Single Viable Approach**: Skip parallel development, use traditional workflow

### **Resource Optimization**
- **Available Approaches < 3**: Consider sequential exploration instead
- **Development Time < 2 hours**: Parallel overhead may exceed benefits
- **Team Size = 1**: Focus on 2-3 most distinct approaches
- **Complex Integration**: Factor merge complexity into approach selection
