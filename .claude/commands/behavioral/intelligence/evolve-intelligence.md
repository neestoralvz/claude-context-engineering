## 🔗 **NATURAL CONNECTIONS**

### **Automatically Triggers**
- `/recognize-patterns` - Identify successful patterns for replication
- `/verification-loops` - Test variations against criteria
- `/living-documentation` - Document evolutionary learnings

### **Compatible With**
- `/parallel-over-sequential` - Run variations simultaneously
- `/tdd` - Define selection criteria upfront
- `/objective-decomposition` - Evolve solutions for sub-objectives

### **Feeds Into**
- Pattern crystallization (successful evolutions become commands)
- Knowledge hierarchy (evolutionary learnings become organizational knowledge)
- Decision engine optimization (successful patterns inform routing)

---

## 📋 **USAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Algorithm Optimization**
```
/evolve-intelligence "Optimize database query performance" 5 "response_time < 50ms"
```
**Result**: AI generates 5 different optimization approaches, tests each, evolves best combination

### **Architecture Design**
```
/evolve-intelligence "Design scalable microservices architecture"
```
**Result**: AI creates multiple architectural variations, evaluates trade-offs, evolves optimal design

### **Problem Solving**
```
/evolve-intelligence "Reduce memory usage in image processing pipeline" 4
```
**Result**: AI explores 4 different memory optimization strategies, evolves hybrid solution

---

## 🛡️ **FALLBACK PROTOCOL**

### **If Command Fails**
1. **Insufficient Variations**: Reduce variation count to 3, focus on quality
2. **Poor Selection Criteria**: Automatically trigger `/tdd` for better criteria
3. **No Evolution Progress**: Manually analyze variations, adjust selection logic
4. **Pattern Recognition Failure**: Document attempted approaches for future analysis

### **Recovery Strategy**
- Maintain variation logs for learning from failures
- Fall back to single best approach if evolution stalls
- Use simplified selection criteria if complex criteria fail
- Create baseline for future evolutionary improvements

---

## 📊 **INTEGRATION WITH DECISION ENGINE**

### **Confidence-Based Routing**
- **High Confidence Objective (≥90%)**: Standard 3-variation evolution
- **Medium Confidence (75-90%)**: Extended 5-variation evolution with deeper analysis
- **Low Confidence (<75%)**: Mandatory `/exploration-first` before evolution
- **Complex Objectives**: Chain with `/objective-decomposition` for sub-evolution

### **Pattern Recognition**
- Successful variation patterns → Crystallization into specialized commands
- Evolution strategies that consistently work → Template evolution approaches
- Failed evolution attempts → Improved variation generation
- Selection criteria effectiveness → Better criteria templates

---
