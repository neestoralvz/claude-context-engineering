# Orchestrator Command: `/command-orchestration-workflow` (aliases: `/orchestrate`, `/coordinate`)

## **Workflow Orchestrator: Intelligent Command Orchestration System**
**Combines Dynamic Recovery Protocol + Command-Based Routing + Multi-Agent Deployment**

---

## 🎯 **ORCHESTRATOR DEFINITION**

### **Purpose**
Coordinate intelligent command orchestration that dynamically routes execution strategies based on confidence levels, implements fallback protocols, and deploys specialized agents for optimal task completion.

### **Complexity**: 1.4/1.5
### **Context Required**: Task objective, complexity assessment, and confidence levels
### **Execution Time**: Variable (2-30 minutes depending on routing strategy)

---

## ⚡ **ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL**

### **Input Format**
```
/command-orchestration-workflow [objective] [confidence_override?] [agent_limit?]
```

### **Command Chain Execution**
1. **`/decision-engine`** - Analyze task complexity and confidence levels
2. **`/command-relationships`** - Map available commands and dependencies
3. **Dynamic Routing** - Select execution strategy based on confidence analysis
4. **Command Execution** - Execute selected strategy with fallback monitoring
5. **Recovery Protocol** - Apply fallback strategies if execution fails

### **Orchestration Logic**
```javascript
function executeCommandOrchestration(objective, confidence_override, agent_limit) {
  // Phase 1: Analysis Foundation
  const analysis = await execute('/decision-engine', {
    objective,
    complexity_assessment: true,
    confidence_calculation: true
  })
  
  // Phase 2: Command Mapping
  const command_map = await execute('/command-relationships', {
    available_commands: getRegistryCommands(),
    dependency_analysis: true
  })
  
  // Phase 3: Dynamic Strategy Selection
  const confidence = confidence_override || analysis.confidence_level
  const strategy = selectExecutionStrategy(confidence, analysis.complexity)
  
  // Phase 4: Execution with Monitoring
  const execution_result = await executeStrategy(strategy, {
    objective,
    command_map,
    fallback_ready: true
  })
  
  // Phase 5: Recovery if Needed
  if (execution_result.requires_recovery) {
    return await executeRecoveryProtocol(execution_result, command_map)
  }
  
  return execution_result
}
```

### **Phase 2: Command Ecosystem Mapping (`/command-relationships`)**
**Objective**: Complete understanding of available commands and dependencies
- Map all available commands from registry
- Analyze command dependencies and relationships
- Identify resource conflicts and coordination requirements
- Plan dependency-optimized execution order

**Verification**: Command map complete, dependencies analyzed, execution order planned

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Strategy Selection (Intelligence-Driven)**
**Objective**: Select optimal execution approach based on confidence analysis

#### **High Confidence Route (≥90%)**
- Execute atomic commands in parallel when possible
- Use direct command execution without orchestration overhead
- Apply parallel optimization for maximum efficiency
- Monitor for opportunities to increase parallelization

#### **Medium Confidence Route (70-90%)**
- Use orchestrated workflow coordination
- Execute established workflow patterns
- Maintain coordination oversight throughout execution
- Apply proven orchestration patterns

#### **Low Confidence Route (50-70%)**
- Coordinate multiple workflows via parallel deployment
- Use comprehensive exploration before execution
- Apply multiple verification layers
- Increase monitoring and validation frequency

#### **Very Low Confidence Route (<50%)**
- Deploy up to 10 specialized agents
- Each agent focuses on specific domain or aspect
- Coordinate multiple specializations simultaneously
- Synthesize diverse agent outputs into unified understanding

**Verification**: Execution strategy selected and validated, resources allocated appropriately

### **Phase 4: Monitored Execution (Strategy-Dependent)**
**Objective**: Execute selected strategy with continuous monitoring and adaptation
- Implement selected execution strategy
- Monitor execution progress and confidence levels
- Detect deviation patterns requiring intervention
- Maintain fallback readiness throughout execution
- Apply real-time strategy adjustments when beneficial

**Verification**: Execution progressing according to strategy, monitoring active, fallbacks ready

### **Phase 5: Dynamic Recovery Protocol (Command-Driven)**
**Objective**: Intelligent fallback and recovery when primary execution fails

#### **Fallback Strategy Selection Process**
1. **Analyze Failure Context**: Use `/decision-engine` to understand what failed and why
2. **Identify Available Alternatives**: Check command registry for alternative approaches
3. **Select Recovery Approach Based on Analysis**:
   - **Atomic Fallback**: Use alternative atomic command if available
   - **Orchestrator Escalation**: Use orchestrator workflow for recovery coordination
   - **Agent Deployment**: Deploy specialized agents via `/parallel-over-sequential`
4. **Execute Recovery Strategy**: Implement selected fallback approach
5. **Document Recovery Pattern**: Capture fallback usage for future optimization

**Verification**: Recovery strategy executed successfully, failure patterns documented

## 🔍 **COMMAND-BASED ROUTING SYSTEM**

### **Intelligent Routing Process**
```javascript
function selectExecutionStrategy(confidence, complexity) {
  const routing_parameters = calculateRoutingParameters(confidence, complexity)
  
  if (confidence >= 0.90) {
    return {
      type: 'direct_atomic',
      commands: selectOptimalAtomicCommands(routing_parameters),
      parallelization: assessParallelOpportunities(routing_parameters),
      monitoring: 'light'
    }
  } else if (confidence >= 0.70) {
    return {
      type: 'orchestrated_workflow',
      orchestrator: selectOptimalOrchestrator(routing_parameters),
      coordination: 'standard',
      monitoring: 'moderate'
    }
  } else if (confidence >= 0.50) {
    return {
      type: 'multi_workflow',
      workflows: selectMultipleWorkflows(routing_parameters),
      coordination: 'heavy',
      monitoring: 'intensive'
    }
  } else {
    return {
      type: 'specialized_agents',
      agent_count: calculateOptimalAgentCount(complexity),
      specializations: identifyRequiredSpecializations(routing_parameters),
      coordination: 'comprehensive',
      monitoring: 'maximum'
    }
  }
}
```

### **Multi-Agent Deployment Protocol**
When confidence < 50%, deploy up to 10 specialized agents:

**Specialized Agent Deployment Process**:
1. **Analyze Agent Requirements**: Determine optimal number and type of specialized agents needed
2. **Deploy Agents via Single-Message Execution**:
   - **Agent 1**: Domain specialist (e.g., security, performance, UX)
   - **Agent 2**: Technical specialist (e.g., database, API, frontend)
   - **Agent 3**: Pattern analyst (existing code patterns and solutions)
   - **Agent 4**: Risk assessor (potential issues and mitigation)
   - **Agent 5**: Performance optimizer (scalability and efficiency)
   - **Agents 6-10**: Additional specialists based on task complexity
3. **Assign Context-Specific Loading Per Agent**:
   - Each agent receives only context relevant to their specialization
   - Apply context economy principle to minimize cognitive load
   - Maintain context overlap for coordination
4. **Enable Recursive Sub-Agent Spawning**:
   - Agents can spawn their own sub-agents for complex sub-tasks
   - Maintain overall 10-agent limit across all levels
   - Preserve context chain through spawning levels
5. **Coordinate Synthesis and Results**:
   - Primary coordination agent synthesizes all specialist outputs
   - Resolve conflicts between specialist recommendations
   - Create unified solution from diverse specialist inputs
