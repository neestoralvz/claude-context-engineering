# Command Registry Update Report

## Summary
Updated the command-registry.json with precise counts based on the defined methodology.

## Methodology Used
The registry counts only **primary registered commands** that are actively tracked in the JSON structure, not all markdown files in the commands directory.

## Updates Made

### Count Corrections
- **Executable Commands**: 30 → 31 (corrected to match actual registered entries)
- **Behavioral Commands**: 38 → 37 (corrected to match actual registered entries)
- **Total Commands**: 75 → 76 (updated to reflect accurate total)

### Timestamp Updates
- **lastUpdated**: 2025-07-16T16:00:00Z → 2025-07-17T08:30:00Z
- **lastCalculated**: 2025-07-16T19:30:00Z → 2025-07-17T08:30:00Z

## Current Registry Statistics
```json
{
  "totalCommands": 76,
  "activeCommands": 76,
  "executableCommands": 31,
  "behavioralCommands": 37,
  "coreCommands": 6,
  "sharedCommands": 2
}
```

## File Count vs Registry Count Analysis

### Actual Files on Disk
- **Executable**: 66 files
- **Behavioral**: 41 files  
- **Cores**: 8 files
- **Shared**: 11 files
- **Total**: 126 files

### Registered Commands
- **Executable**: 31 commands
- **Behavioral**: 37 commands
- **Cores**: 6 commands
- **Shared**: 2 commands
- **Total**: 76 commands

### Difference Explanation
The registry counts only **primary commands** that are actively registered for use. The additional files (126 - 76 = 50 files) include:

1. **Component Modules**: Supporting modules like `think-process-core.md`, `decision-logic-core.md`
2. **Compliance Documentation**: Framework files in `meta/compliance/`
3. **Integration Components**: Files in subdirectories like `validate-command-content/`
4. **Templates and Examples**: Support files and patterns
5. **Documentation**: README and explanatory files
6. **Archived/Backup Files**: Historical versions

## Path Inconsistency Identified
The registry uses `./commands/` paths but actual files are in `docs/commands/`. This needs to be addressed in a future update.

## Validation Results
✅ All counts in registry now match actual registered entries
✅ Statistics section synchronized with category counts
✅ Timestamps updated to reflect current update
✅ JSON structure validated and functional

## Next Steps
1. Address path inconsistency in registry (all paths should use `docs/commands/`)
2. Consider adding metadata to distinguish primary commands from support files
3. Implement automated registry maintenance to keep counts accurate
4. Update CLAUDE.md references to reflect 76 commands instead of 75

## Conclusion
The registry now accurately reflects the **76 primary registered commands** using the established methodology that counts only active command entries, not all markdown files in the commands directory.
