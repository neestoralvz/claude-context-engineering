## Command Matrix Integration

**MANDATORY STEPS** when using this template:
1. **Add to Command Matrix**: Register as üéØ Orchestrator in `/docs/commands/philosophy/command-matrix.md`
2. **Document Dependencies**: List Decision Engine validation and strategic thinking framework coordination
3. **Validate Composition**: Ensure no duplication of research or analysis functionality, only progressive strategic planning
4. **Update Used By**: Document strategic orchestration relationships with strategic implementation and strategic validation commands

**Orchestrator Classification**: This command is a **üéØ Orchestrator** that coordinates progressive strategic thinking analysis and Decision Engine validation.

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Architecture Pattern section identifies as üéØ Orchestrator
- [ ] Modular Composition lists specific strategic thinking and strategic validation coordination with clear strategic responsibilities
- [ ] Used By relationships show strategic implementation and strategic workflow integration possibilities
- [ ] No analysis or research functionality duplication (uses strategic thinking progression and strategic validation only)
- [ ] Command Matrix Orchestrator section updated with strategic planning coordination dependencies
- [ ] Decision Engine integration properly documented and implemented
- [ ] Output organization follows docs/operations/outputs/ structure

**Anti-Pattern Prevention**:
- ‚ùå **Research Reimplementation** - Use strategic thinking progression, not research duplication
- ‚ùå **Mega-Strategic-Planner** - Focus on strategic planning, not everything
- ‚ùå **Silent Dependencies** - Document strategic thinking frameworks and strategic validation coordination
