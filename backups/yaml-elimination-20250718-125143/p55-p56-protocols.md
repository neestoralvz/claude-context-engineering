project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md (ONLY exception)
├── README.md (ONLY exception)
├── docs/
├── scripts/
├── projects/
└── [organized-subdirectories]/
```

### 82. Maximum Density Optimization Standards
**🚨 CRITICAL Definition**: MANDATORY communication efficiency protocol that REQUIRES 70%+ character reduction in ALL notifications, status updates, and operational communications while PRESERVING 100% essential information through mathematical optimization and research-backed density patterns.

**See Also**: [Context Economy](./core-principles.md#20-context-economy) | [Token-Saving Intelligence](#83-token-saving-intelligence)

**MANDATORY Density Optimization Framework**:

**CRITICAL Communication Patterns**:
```markdown
❌ VERBOSE (Traditional Pattern):
"I'm now beginning the analysis of your notification patterns. This will involve examining the various scripts and their output formats to identify optimization opportunities. I'll provide you with comprehensive results when the analysis is complete."

✅ COMPRESSED (Optimized Pattern):
⟳ Notifications → 72scripts analyzed → Patterns extracted [2.1s]
```

**REQUIRED Symbol System**:
- **⟳** = Process/Operation in progress
- **◉** = Critical/Priority item
- **✓** = Completed successfully  
- **⚠** = Warning/Attention required
- **[time]** = Execution duration for operations >1 second

**MANDATORY Implementation Patterns**:
- **Status Updates**: `⟳ operation → result [time]`
- **Progress Reports**: `Phase 3/5 ██████░░░░ 60% operation`
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: `◉ 3 Task agents → Codebase + Patterns + Validation [deploying]`

- **Quality Preservation**: MAINTAIN 100% information value retention
- **Efficiency Measurement**: IMPLEMENT mathematical validation of token savings
- **Budget Management**: EXECUTE systematic token allocation and conservation

**REQUIRED Mathematical Formulas**:
- **Token Efficiency**: `TE = ((O-C)/O) × 100, where O=original tokens, C=compressed tokens`
- **Compression Ratio**: `CR = C/O, target: 0.4-0.6 (40-60% reduction)`
- **Quality Coefficient**: `QC = InformationValue(compressed)/InformationValue(original), target: ≥1.0`
- **Budget Utilization**: `BU = TokensUsed/TokensBudgeted, target: ≤0.8 (80% utilization)`

**MANDATORY AI-to-AI Patterns**:
- **Response Optimization**: IMPLEMENT dense, symbol-rich communication between AI agents
- **Context Compression**: DEPLOY dynamic context size management based on complexity
- **Handoff Efficiency**: EXECUTE minimal token handoff protocols with maximum context preservation
- **Coordination Patterns**: UTILIZE ultra-compact multi-agent coordination protocols

**Token Budget Management System**:
The token budget allocation system distributes computational resources across five critical areas within the total available budget. Context loading receives 30-40% allocation for essential system understanding. Analysis tasks consume 20-30% for cognitive processing requirements. Response generation utilizes 15-25% for output synthesis and communication. Multi-agent coordination allocates 10-15% for parallel system orchestration. Reserve capacity maintains 10-20% for unexpected complexity handling.
