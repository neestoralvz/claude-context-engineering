### **Implementation Requirements - MANDATORY**

1. **Pre-Phase Announcement**: ALWAYS display phase announcement before each verification phase
2. **Task Agent Transparency**: Show Task agent deployment for complex verification operations
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Display verification progress and confidence scoring throughout workflow
4. **Sight Tracking**: Announce activation of each verification sight type (5 types)
5. **Phase Completion**: Show completion status with confidence metrics for each phase
6. **Workflow Handoff**: Announce completion and readiness for documentation workflow
7. **Error Handling**: Surface verification failures immediately with recovery actions

### **Bidirectional Communication Protocol - MANDATORY**

When deploying Task agents for verification, the LLM MUST:

1. **Initialize Verification Communication**: Establish communication bridge for verification specialists
2. **Deploy Verification Specialists**: Use Task tool for complex multi-dimensional verification and mathematical analysis
3. **Monitor Verification Progress**: Track verification agent progress and confidence scoring development
4. **Display Verification Updates**: Show verification progression and mathematical validation results
5. **Handle Verification Handoffs**: Properly receive verification intelligence from specialized agents
6. **Report Verification Results**: Display comprehensive verification outcomes and confidence scores
7. **Maintain Verification Transparency**: Never allow "verification black holes" where user loses visibility

### **Verification Quality Display - MANDATORY**

During verification workflow execution, display comprehensive metrics:

```

### **Compliance Enforcement - CRITICAL**

- **NEVER skip phase announcements**: Every verification phase must be visually announced
- **NEVER hide verification progress**: All multi-dimensional verification progress must be visible
- **NEVER skip Task agent deployment**: Complex verification requires specialized agents
- **ALWAYS show verification metrics**: Display comprehensive verification quality and confidence scores
- **ALWAYS display sight activation**: Show activation status of all 5 verification sight types
- **ALWAYS handle verification handoffs**: Proper handoff from verification specialists to principal agent

**P55/P56 Compliance**: This orchestrator integrates Tool Call Execution Bridging (P55) through mandatory Task agent deployment for complex verification operations and Command Execution Transparency (P56) through comprehensive visual announcements of all verification workflow phases and multi-dimensional validation activities.
