# Compact Task Coordination Feedback

**Compact system for Task tool coordination** with dense feedback and high transparency.

## 🎯 Task Tool Communication Patterns

### **Deployment Patterns**

#### Multi-Agent Launch
```markdown
◉ 3 Task agents → Research + Analysis + Validation [deploying]
```

#### Specialized Assignment
```markdown
◉ Agent 1 → Codebase scan (scripts/)
◉ Agent 2 → Pattern analysis (notifications) 
◉ Agent 3 → Validation check (P55/P56)
```

#### Parallel Coordination
```markdown
◉ 3 agents || → Parallel execution → Dependency detection active
```

### **Status Tracking Patterns**

#### Individual Agent Status
```markdown
✓ Agent 1 → 72 scripts analyzed → Patterns identified
⟳ Agent 2 → Command structure 60% complete  
⚠ Agent 3 → Validation issues → Details pending
```

#### Consolidated Progress
```markdown
◉ Progress: Agent1✓ Agent2⟳ Agent3⚠ → 2/3 complete
```

#### Completion Summary
```markdown
✓ 3 agents → Results consolidated → Analysis complete [5.7s]
```

### **Result Integration Patterns**

#### Data Merge
```markdown
✓ Agent synthesis → 72scripts + 16modules + 12authorities → 85% optimization identified
```

#### Cross-Reference Results
```markdown
✓ Cross-validation → Agent1⊕Agent2⊕Agent3 → Consistent findings confirmed
```

#### Conflict Resolution
```markdown
⚠ Agent conflict → A1:optimize vs A2:preserve → Resolution: hybrid approach
```

## 🔧 Task Coordination Functions

### **cn_task_deploy()** - Agent Deployment
```bash
cn_task_deploy 3 "Research + Analysis + Validation" "parallel"
# Output: ◉ 3 Task agents → Research + Analysis + Validation [parallel]
```

### **cn_task_status()** - Individual Agent Status  
```bash
cn_task_status "Agent 1" "ok" "72 scripts analyzed" "patterns identified"
# Output: ✓ Agent 1 → 72 scripts analyzed → patterns identified
```

### **cn_task_progress()** - Multi-Agent Progress
```bash
cn_task_progress "Agent1✓ Agent2⟳ Agent3⚠" "2/3 complete"
# Output: ◉ Progress: Agent1✓ Agent2⟳ Agent3⚠ → 2/3 complete
```

### **cn_task_merge()** - Result Consolidation
```bash
cn_task_merge 3 "Results consolidated" "Analysis complete" "5.7s"
# Output: ✓ 3 agents → Results consolidated → Analysis complete [5.7s]
```

### **cn_task_conflict()** - Conflict Resolution
```bash
cn_task_conflict "Agent conflict" "A1:optimize vs A2:preserve" "hybrid approach"
# Output: ⚠ Agent conflict → A1:optimize vs A2:preserve → Resolution: hybrid approach
```

## 📊 Use Case Examples

### **Codebase Analysis**
```markdown
User: "Analyze the notification system comprehensively"

Claude Response:
◉ 3 Task agents → Scripts + Patterns + Standards [deploying]
⟳ Agent coordination → Parallel execution → Dependencies mapped

[After deployment]
✓ Agent 1 → 72 scripts scanned → Notification patterns found
⟳ Agent 2 → Pattern analysis 80% → Optimization opportunities identified  
✓ Agent 3 → Standards check complete → Compliance gaps found

[Consolidation]
✓ 3 agents → Results merged → 70% optimization potential identified [4.2s]
```

### **Feature Implementation**
```markdown
User: "Implement compact notifications across the system"

Claude Response:
◉ 2 Task agents → Library creation + Migration strategy [active]

✓ Agent 1 → Compact library created → 12 functions implemented
⟳ Agent 2 → Migration plan 60% → 15 scripts identified for update

✓ 2 agents → Implementation ready → Migration can begin [3.1s]
```

### **Validation Workflow**
```markdown
User: "Validate system integrity after changes"

Claude Response:
◉ 4 Task agents → Commands + Math + Links + Compliance [validating]

✓ Agent 1 → 76 commands validated → All functional
✓ Agent 2 → Mathematical formulas verified → Precision confirmed
⚠ Agent 3 → Link validation → 3 broken links found
✗ Agent 4 → Compliance check → P56 transparency gaps

⚠ 4 agents → 3✓ 1⚠ 1✗ → Action required: fix links + P56 compliance [6.8s]
```

## 🚀 Advanced Coordination Patterns

### **Dependency Chains**
```markdown
◉ Chain: Agent1→Agent2→Agent3 → Sequential dependency execution
     ✓      ⟳      ⚪    → Agent 2 waiting for Agent 1 completion
```

### **Resource Optimization**
```markdown
◉ Resource allocation → A1:CPU70% A2:MEM45% A3:DISK30% → Optimal distribution
```

### **Error Recovery**
```markdown
✗ Agent 2 failed → Auto-recovery initiated → ✓ Agent 2b deployed [1.2s]
```

### **Dynamic Scaling**
```markdown
◉ 3→5 agents → Complexity increased → Additional agents deployed [scaling]
```

## 📋 Integration Standards

### **Command Integration Points**

#### `/context-eng` Task Coordination
```markdown
⟳ /context-eng → ◉ 5 agents → Discovery + Analysis + Planning + Execution + Validation
✓ Agent deployment → System capabilities fully activated [2.8s]
```

#### `/orchestrate` Workflow Tasks
```markdown
⟳ /orchestrate → ◉ 3 agents → Pipeline + Validation + Monitoring [coordinating]
✓ Workflow ready → Execution pipeline validated [1.9s]
```

#### `/verify-flow` Validation Tasks
```markdown
⟳ /verify-flow → ◉ 4 agents → Math + Links + Commands + Compliance [verifying]
✓ Validation complete → ✓12 ⚠3 ✗1 → Fix guidance provided [4.7s]
```

### **P55/P56 Compliance Integration**

#### Transparent Task Deployment
```markdown
🛡️ P55 VISUAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Multi-agent task coordination system activated
◉ 3 Task tools → Parallel execution for comprehensive analysis coverage
⟳ Transparency protocol → Real-time agent status + result consolidation
```

#### Tool Execution Clarity
```markdown
🔧 P56 TOOL EXECUTION: Task agent deployment with parallel coordination
◉ Agent status → Individual progress tracking + consolidated reporting
✓ Execution complete → Results merged with full transparency [time]
```

### **Performance Metrics Integration**

#### Efficiency Tracking
```markdown
◉ Agent efficiency → A1:95% A2:87% A3:92% → Average: 91.3% performance
```

#### Resource Utilization
```markdown
◉ Resource usage → CPU: 45% MEM: 2.1G NET: optimal → Efficient allocation
```

#### Time Optimization
```markdown
◉ Parallel benefit → Sequential: 12.5s vs Parallel: 4.2s → 66% time savings
```
