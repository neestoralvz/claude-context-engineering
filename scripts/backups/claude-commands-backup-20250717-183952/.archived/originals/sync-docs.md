# System Command: `/sync-claude-md`

## **Principle #53: Intelligent Context Map with Lazy Loading**
**"Maintain CLAUDE.md as an ultra-efficient context map with philosophical core + progressive thinking, loading additional context dynamically as needed."

**Core Philosophy**: Enable through minimal permanent context (philosophical foundations + progressive thinking) while providing intelligent lazy loading for specific needs.

---

## 🎯 **COMMAND DEFINITION**

### **Purpose**
Maintain CLAUDE.md as an intelligent context map that:
1. **Always loads**: Philosophical foundations + Progressive thinking
2. **Lazy loads**: Specific principles and commands as needed
3. **Optimizes**: Using `/optimize-intelligent-writing` for maximum cognitive efficiency
4. **Adapts**: Progressive thinking for complex optimizations

### **Complexity**: 1.1/1.0
### **Context Required**: Philosophical core + Progressive thinking + Registry data
### **Execution Time**: 30-90 seconds (lazy loading optimization)

## ⚡ **ACTIVATION PROTOCOL**

### **Input Format**
```
/sync-claude-md [sync_scope?] [metrics_update?]
```

### **Enhanced Execution Protocol with Bidirectional Communication**
**Implements**: [Task Agent Communication Protocol](../../protocols/task-agent-communication-protocol.md) and enhanced Principle #56 requirements

### **What This Command Does**
1. **Task Agent Deployment with Communication Bridge**: Deploy Task agent with bidirectional status reporting
2. **Initialization Status Report**: Task agent reports deployment and execution plan to Principal agent
3. **Philosophical Core Loading**: Always load 5 philosophical foundations as permanent context
4. **Progressive Thinking Integration**: Enable deep analysis capabilities for complex decisions

6. **Lazy Loading Engine**: Dynamically load specific principles/commands based on detected needs
7. **Intelligent Writing Optimization**: Apply `/optimize-intelligent-writing` for ≥95% density, ≥85% concisión
8. **Context Map Synthesis**: Create ultra-efficient navigation structure (≤3 cognitive steps)
9. **Auto-Detection**: Identify when additional context loading is needed
10. **Registry Synchronization**: Update metrics while preserving optimized structure
11. **Completion Handoff**: Task agent transfers control back to Principal agent with results
12. **User Progress Visibility**: Principal agent displays Task agent progress throughout execution

### **Enhanced Mandatory Requirements**
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Task agent MUST maintain communication with Principal agent
- **Status Reporting**: Progress updates every 30 seconds maximum during execution
- **Completion Handoff**: Task agent MUST transfer control back to Principal agent
- **User Visibility**: Principal agent MUST display Task agent progress to user
- **Philosophical Core**: Always maintain 5 philosophical principles loaded
- **Progressive Thinking**: Keep progressive thinking engine available
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load additional context when specifically needed
- **Cognitive Efficiency**: ≤3 mental steps for any navigation
- **Writing Optimization**: Apply intelligent writing standards (≥95% density)
- **Progressive Analysis**: Use progressive thinking for complex optimizations
- **Communication Recovery**: Handle communication failures with automatic recovery
