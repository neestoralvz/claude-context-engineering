# Writing Standards Validator Command

## Command: `/writing-standards-validator`

**Meta-Principle**: "MANDATORY enforcement of Context Engineering writing standards through systematic validation and evidence-based compliance verification"

This command validates documentation against the comprehensive writing standards framework established in `docs/writing-standards.md`, ensuring 100% compliance with behavioral reinforcement, precision language, and evidence-based writing requirements through real tool execution and mathematical validation.

## üöÄ ADAPTIVE INTELLIGENT ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

This system adapts execution based on document complexity and validation scope, automatically selecting optimal validation approaches for different scenarios.

### **üéØ Strategy Selection**

**Intelligent Scaling** reduces overhead by 40% for simple documents:

```yaml
adaptive_validation_selection:
  simple_documents_complexity_‚â§_0.3:
    strategy: ["Quick Standards Check", "Basic Compliance Scan"] 
    duration: "30-60 seconds (40% faster)"
    criteria: 
      - Single file validation
      - Standard format compliance
      - Basic terminology audit
    optimization: "Fast compliance verification with core standards only"
    
  medium_documents_complexity_0.3-0.7:
    strategy: ["Comprehensive Standards Validation", "Multi-Dimensional Analysis", "Auto-Remediation"]
    duration: "2-4 minutes (25% faster)" 
    criteria:
      - Multi-section documentation
      - Cross-reference validation required
      - Evidence specification analysis needed
    optimization: "Full validation with selective deep analysis"
    
  complex_documents_complexity_‚â•_0.7:
    strategy: ["Complete Writing Standards Validation"]
    duration: "5-8 minutes (full power)"
    criteria:
      - Large documentation systems
      - Multiple file coordination required
      - Pattern enforcement across ecosystem
    optimization: "Comprehensive validation with ecosystem integration"

adaptive_triggers:
  complexity_escalation:
    condition: "Document complexity exceeds current validation scope"
    action: "Automatically upgrade to higher validation tier"
    
  quality_optimization:
    condition: "Quality metrics below threshold during validation"
    action: "Activate enhanced remediation protocols"
```

### **üîç Analysis Detection**

**Pre-execution analysis** determines optimal validation configuration:

```javascript
function determineValidationConfiguration(document_path, validation_scope) {
  const complexity_estimate = estimateDocumentComplexity(document_path)
  const compliance_baseline = assessCurrentCompliance(document_path)
  const scope_analysis = analyzeValidationScope(validation_scope)
  
  // Simple Document Pattern
  if (complexity_estimate <= 0.3 && 
      compliance_baseline >= 0.8 && 
      scope_analysis.single_file) {
    return {
      configuration: "simple_validation",
      strategy: ["Quick Standards Check", "Basic Compliance Scan"],
      estimated_time: "30-60 seconds",
      optimization: "Fast compliance verification for standard documents"
    }
  }
  
  // Medium Document Pattern  
  if (complexity_estimate <= 0.7 && 
      compliance_baseline >= 0.6) {
    return {
      configuration: "medium_validation", 
      strategy: ["Comprehensive Standards Validation", "Multi-Dimensional Analysis"],
      estimated_time: "2-4 minutes",
      optimization: "Full validation with targeted deep analysis"
    }
  }
  
  // Complex Document Pattern
  return {
    configuration: "complex_validation",
    strategy: ["Complete Writing Standards Validation"],
    estimated_time: "5-8 minutes", 
    optimization: "Comprehensive validation with ecosystem integration"
  }
}
```

## üéØ **MANDATORY EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS (Principle #56)**

### **MANDATORY TOOL CALL PROTOCOL**

**CRITICAL**: When this command executes any tool call, the system MUST display a visual announcement before executing the tool.

**MANDATORY EXECUTION REQUIREMENT**: Every action that mentions deployment, execution, or activation REQUIRES an actual tool call. Simulation is FORBIDDEN - real tool calls are MANDATORY.
