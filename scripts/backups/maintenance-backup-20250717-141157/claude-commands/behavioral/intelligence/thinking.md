```

### **Implementation Requirements - MANDATORY**

1. **Pre-Stage Announcement**: ALWAYS display stage announcement before each thinking stage
2. **Task Agent Transparency**: Show Task agent deployment for complex strategic analysis
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Display thinking progress and quality assessment throughout stages
4. **Breakthrough Tracking**: Announce breakthrough insights and innovation achievements
5. **Stage Completion**: Show completion status with quality metrics for each stage
6. **Synthesis Display**: Announce final synthesis and strategic intelligence integration
7. **Error Handling**: Surface thinking failures immediately with recovery actions

### **Bidirectional Communication Protocol - MANDATORY**

When deploying Task agents for progressive thinking, the LLM MUST:

1. **Initialize Strategic Communication**: Establish communication bridge for thinking specialists
2. **Deploy Thinking Specialists**: Use Task tool for complex analytical and strategic thinking
3. **Monitor Thinking Progress**: Track thinking agent progress and quality metrics
4. **Display Strategic Updates**: Show thinking progression and insight development
5. **Handle Thinking Handoffs**: Properly receive strategic intelligence from thinking agents
6. **Report Strategic Results**: Display comprehensive strategic analysis and insights
7. **Maintain Thinking Transparency**: Never allow "thinking black holes" where user loses visibility

### **Progressive Thinking Quality Display - MANDATORY**

During progressive thinking execution, display quality metrics:

```

üí° Innovation Level: [score]/10 | Insight Quality: [assessment]
‚ö° Implementation Readiness: [score]/10 | Strategic Impact: [assessment]
```

### **Compliance Enforcement - CRITICAL**

- **NEVER skip stage announcements**: Every thinking stage must be visually announced
- **NEVER hide thinking progress**: All strategic analysis progress must be visible
- **NEVER skip Task agent deployment**: Complex thinking requires specialized agents
- **ALWAYS show quality metrics**: Display thinking quality and breakthrough achievement
- **ALWAYS display synthesis**: Show final strategic intelligence integration
- **ALWAYS handle thinking handoffs**: Proper handoff from thinking specialists to principal agent

**P55/P56 Compliance**: This command integrates Tool Call Execution Bridging (P55) through mandatory Task agent deployment for complex thinking and Command Execution Transparency (P56) through comprehensive visual announcements of all progressive thinking stages and strategic analysis operations.
