## üõ°Ô∏è **FALLBACK PROTOCOL**

### **If Decomposition Fails**
1. **Complexity Overload**: Use simpler decomposition with fewer levels

- Use iterative refinement to improve decomposition quality
- Document decomposition rationale for future reference
- Create templates for similar objective types
