## Architecture Pattern
**🎯 Universal Strategic Meta-Orchestrator** - Adaptive AI-orchestrated strategic intelligence engine that can handle ANY prompt through intelligent analysis, exploration, strategic thinking, dynamic execution, and verification

**Modular Composition:**
- **Uses strategic request analysis intelligence** (internal classification engine) - for understanding strategic request type, complexity, and optimal approach
- **Uses comprehensive strategic exploration** (`/scan-code`, `/scan-arch`, `/find-patterns`, `/find-tech`, `/scan-git-status`, Context7 MCP, WebSearch) - for gathering complete strategic context and intelligence
- **Uses Git strategy intelligence** (`/git-strategy-optimize`, `/git-workflow`, `/github-pr-workflow`, `/branch-workflow`) - for strategic Git workflow optimization and team coordination
- **Uses enhanced progressive strategic thinking** (internal strategic thinking framework enhanced with exploration results) - for deep strategic analysis combining all gathered intelligence
- **Uses dynamic strategic execution orchestration** (command selection and coordination engine) - for automatically choosing and coordinating optimal strategic command execution

## Command Matrix Integration

**MANDATORY STEPS** when using this template:
1. **Add to Command Matrix**: Register as 🎯 Orchestrator in `/docs/commands/philosophy/command-matrix.md`
2. **Document Dependencies**: List Decision Engine validation and strategic thinking framework coordination
3. **Validate Composition**: Ensure no duplication of research or analysis functionality, only progressive strategic planning
4. **Update Used By**: Document strategic orchestration relationships with strategic implementation and strategic validation commands

**Orchestrator Classification**: This command is a **🎯 Orchestrator** that coordinates progressive strategic thinking analysis and Decision Engine validation.

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Architecture Pattern section identifies as 🎯 Orchestrator
- [ ] Modular Composition lists specific strategic thinking and strategic validation coordination with clear strategic responsibilities
- [ ] Used By relationships show strategic implementation and strategic workflow integration possibilities
- [ ] No analysis or research functionality duplication (uses strategic thinking progression and strategic validation only)
- [ ] Command Matrix Orchestrator section updated with strategic planning coordination dependencies
- [ ] Decision Engine integration properly documented and implemented
- [ ] Output organization follows `/docs/outputs/` structure

**Anti-Pattern Prevention**:
- ❌ **Research Reimplementation** - Use strategic thinking progression, not research duplication
- ❌ **Mega-Strategic-Planner** - Focus on strategic planning, not everything
- ❌ **Silent Dependencies** - Document strategic thinking frameworks and strategic validation coordination
