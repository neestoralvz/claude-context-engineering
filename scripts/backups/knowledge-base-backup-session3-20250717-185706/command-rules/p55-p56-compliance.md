# P55/P56 Compliance Rules - Context Engineering

**Meta-Principle**: "Real execution with complete transparency through enhanced command standards"

**Authority Redirect**: Complete P55/P56 compliance standards are consolidated in [Enhanced Command Execution](../technical/enhanced-command-execution.md) for unified implementation across all Context Engineering commands.

**Purpose**: MANDATORY cross-reference hub for P55 (Tool Call Execution Bridging) and P56 (Command Execution Transparency) compliance rules.

## üìã **Quick Reference Navigation**

### **P55 Tool Call Execution Requirements**
**Location**: [Enhanced Command Execution - Tool Call Execution Bridge](../technical/enhanced-command-execution.md#tool-call-execution-bridge-principles-55--56)
- MANDATORY real tool calls vs. FORBIDDEN simulation
- REQUIRED Task agent deployment protocols
- CRITICAL completion guarantee standards (‚â•98% success rate)

### **P56 Transparency Requirements**
**Location**: [Enhanced Command Execution - Command Transparency](../technical/enhanced-command-execution.md#command-transparency-principle-56)
- Visual announcement requirement protocols
- Task agent priority system implementation
- Performance tracking and compliance verification

### **Tool Call Execution Matrix**
**Location**: [Enhanced Command Execution - Execution Framework Architecture](../technical/enhanced-command-execution.md#execution-framework-architecture)
- Task tool deployment standards
- Bash tool execution requirements
- Read/Edit/Write tool compliance protocols

## üéØ **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Compliance Validation Protocol**
**Authority Reference**: [Enhanced Command Execution - Compliance Protocols](../technical/enhanced-command-execution.md#compliance-and-validation-protocols)
- Systematic P55/P56 protocol integration
- Comprehensive validation frameworks
- Quality assurance standards

### **Cross-Reference Integration**
**Navigation Pattern**: [Knowledge Hub](../README.md) ‚Üí [Technical Implementation](../README.md#technical-implementation) ‚Üí [Enhanced Command Execution](../technical/enhanced-command-execution.md)

**Efficiency Standard**: ‚â§2 cognitive steps to complete P55/P56 compliance specifications from any Context Engineering documentation.
