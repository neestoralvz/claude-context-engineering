## 🎯 **Terminology Strategy: LLM vs Human Optimization**

### **Strong Terminology for LLMs (PRESERVE ALWAYS)**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: ALL LLM instructions MUST be written in English natural language ONLY using strong behavioral reinforcement terminology with ≥80% strong terminology usage.

**Strategic Keywords (ENGLISH ONLY)** (Authority: [Writing Standards](../writing-standards.md#behavioral-reinforcement-through-language) - Complete terminology standards):
- `MANDATORY` - For absolute and inflexible requirements (≥95% compliance REQUIRED)
- `CRITICAL` - For essential system elements (zero tolerance for violations)
- `MUST` / `REQUIRED` - For imperative obligations (≥90% compliance REQUIRED)
- `FORBIDDEN` / `NEVER` - For categorical prohibitions (0% occurrence REQUIRED)
- `ALWAYS` / `EVERY` - For obligatory consistency (100% application REQUIRED)
- `PROHIBITED` - For actions that are strictly forbidden (immediate violation detection)
- `EXECUTE` - For actions that must be performed immediately (≤2 seconds response time)

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER use YAML, JavaScript, JSON, Python, or any code syntax in LLM instruction sections (0% occurrence REQUIRED with automated detection).

**Strategic Rationale**:
These words function as **behavioral control and reinforcement strategies** for LLMs, ensuring important instructions are followed consistently with ≥95% compliance rate. Especially effective for:
- Tool execution protocols with P55/P56 compliance
- Compliance requirements with quantifiable thresholds
- Simulation prohibitions with real execution evidence
- Transparency standards with visual confirmation
- **Enforcement of English-only natural language requirement with 100% compliance**

**EVIDENCE REQUIRED**: Users MUST observe strong terminology achieving ≥90% instruction compliance rate with documented behavioral reinforcement effectiveness.

### **Natural Language for Humans (SIMPLIFY ALWAYS)**

**Human Writing Principles** (Authority: [Writing Standards](../writing-standards.md#cognitive-load-optimization) - Complete cognitive load reduction standards):
- Clear, concise and descriptive titles with ≤7 items per logical group
- Explanations in natural language easy to understand with ≤2.5 seconds processing time
- Neutral, professional and appropriately technical tone with ≥95% precision
- Elimination of unnecessary jargon with maximum information density

**Context-Based Application**:

**CORRECT LLM Instruction Examples**:
- MANDATORY tool execution with REQUIRED transparency protocols
- EXECUTE real scripts with FORBIDDEN simulation behavior
- CRITICAL compliance validation with ALWAYS visible progress tracking

**CORRECT Human Documentation Examples**:
- Este comando utiliza herramientas reales para garantizar transparencia
- Ejecuta scripts automatizados con validación continua
- Proporciona validación de cumplimiento con progreso visible
