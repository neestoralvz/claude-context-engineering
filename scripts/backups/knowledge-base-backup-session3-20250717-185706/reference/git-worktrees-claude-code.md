## 🚀 Implementation Guide

### **Phase 1: Repository Setup**

****1.1 Create Worktrees Directory Structure****
```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your-project

# Create dedicated worktrees directory
mkdir -p ../worktrees

# Verify structure
ls -la ../
# Should show: your-project/ and worktrees/
```

****1.2 Create Your First Worktree****
```bash
# Create worktree for new feature
git worktree add ../worktrees/feature-auth -b feature-auth

# Create worktree from existing branch
git worktree add ../worktrees/bugfix-123 bugfix-123

# List all worktrees
git worktree list
```

### **Phase 2: Claude Code Session Management**

****2.1 Launch Parallel Sessions****
```bash
# Terminal 1: Authentication feature
cd ../worktrees/feature-auth
claude

# Terminal 2: UI components (new terminal)
cd ../worktrees/feature-ui  
claude

# Terminal 3: Performance optimization (new terminal)
cd ../worktrees/bugfix-perf
claude
```

### **2.2 MANDATORY Session Coordination Strategies**

**Individual Focus Approach** (RECOMMENDED for independence):
- Each Claude session SPECIALIZES in ONE specific area
- MINIMAL coordination between sessions
- OPTIMAL for independent features

**Collaborative Approach** (REQUIRED for complexity):
- Sessions work on related but ISOLATED components
- PERIODIC synchronization through main branch
- OPTIMAL for complex features requiring multiple perspectives

1. Complete login endpoint validation
2. Implement JWT middleware
3. Add password reset functionality
```

### **Session Handoff Protocol**
```bash
# Before switching sessions, document current state
echo "$(date): Pausing auth work - login endpoint 80% complete" >> session-log.md
git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: Login endpoint validation logic"

# When resuming session
git log -1 --oneline  # Check last commit
cat session-log.md    # Review session notes
```
