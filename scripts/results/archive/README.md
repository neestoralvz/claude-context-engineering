### **Archived Results** (Archive Directory)
- **Previous Months**: Results older than current month moved to archive
- **Historical Reference**: Maintained for trend analysis and auditing
- **Compressed Storage**: Organized by date and category for efficient access

## 🔧 Archive Management

### **Automated Archiving**

find /scripts/results/ -name "*20250715*" -exec mv {} /scripts/results/archive/2025/07/ \;
```
